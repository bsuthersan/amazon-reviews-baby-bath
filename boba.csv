"B005SP2LWW","I love this wrap! Grows with your changing body and keeps baby secure!","Elizabeth","August 17, 2018",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"I've tried a few wraps out there - but this one - this is the real thing! Many other wraps require you buy a certain size (S, M, L, etc) - this isn't helpful as your body grows or slims with pregnancy. This wrap is extremely versatile, as it moves and grows with you. I've fluxed approximately 60lbs and can still wear this sling snug and tight throughout my body's changes. Also, the product itself is very well made - the fabric is high quality and there's plenty of it to securely swaddle both you and your child, together.I will most definitely be purchasing a second one in the near future! Bonus: so many great color options!",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGLWFOMYR5F254ESNMZJF37J7TJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGLWFOMYR5F254ESNMZJF37J7TJA"

The fabric wasn‚Äôt very stretchy.The ergo baby wrap was the same length as the Boba wrap it has less fabric on the width though and it is also not as stretchy as the boba, the fabric is also cotton and therefore pretty cool.Overall the reason why I kept the Boba wrap was because of its stretchy material.

I had one before, but didn't find myself using it a ton. I found myself using my lillebaby carrier more. So I gave my original wrap to one of my good friends who had just had her third baby, and was having a tough time trying to figure out how to juggle daily tasks and new baby. It completely changed her life, and her husband loves to wear it as well! I then had a trip that I was going to be going on, that I thought I would be nice to have a wrap in conjunction with having my lillebaby carrier. I wasn't sure if I should spend the money for another Boba, so I try to knock off brand. I regretted it instantly as I put the other wrap on. It was way too tight, and had no give to the fabric at all. I'm used to tying tight with the Boba wrap, so I had to completely undo the tie and do it again a little looser, which was just a huge pain in the middle of our event we were attending. I was really bummed, but knew immediately how worth it it was to have a Boba. That night I ordered my new wrap without hesitation. I told my friend that a Boba is gold to have, and I wanted her to keep mine. They are so worth their weight in gold, that I had bought myself another one.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF63QBMTRF5LAPM3DSSP6GFPDYYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF63QBMTRF5LAPM3DSSP6GFPDYYQ"

"B005SP2LWW","Much too large and inconvenient!","EME","July 12, 2018",0,"Format: Baby Product",2,"I was really excited to receive this boba wrap since it had come so highly recommended by reviewers. I am sadly disappointed and currently on the search for a new wrap,however. The wrap is much too large and a hassle to put on. I practiced with it before I gave birth to my little guy and practiced again before carrying him around the first time. I understand how to tie, yet it is nearly impossible to get this wrap tight enough around my body to feel secure. It folds over easily and the material bunches up. I am petite - 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 115 lbs postpartum. My now 4 week old was just about 6.5 lbs at birth and I‚Äôve been carrying him around since. The material itself is certainly stretchy and feels comfortable. I agree with other reviewers it‚Äôs hot for summer time. Baby wrapping is meant to be my main transportation for my baby in and out of the car seat, etc. and this wrap takes much too long to put on and adjust for it to be convenient. While I appreciate the different positions available as baby grows and the quality material, it‚Äôs not worth a recommendation due to its large size and inconvenient design.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGMIGBTT3UQZ7A2ZNNWWY3E6FNRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGMIGBTT3UQZ7A2ZNNWWY3E6FNRQ"

The packaged came in and I opened the box. It was a very long strap, almost like a polyester material. Stretchy and wide. My wife looked at me and was concerned. I told her that the video makes it look easy. I attempted to prepare the wrap by following the instructions. From step 1 to step 2 was ridiculous. Out of nowhere, the lady in the instructions have the wrap inside the first wrap on your body. What a joke! After I finished the instructions successfully, I looked at my wife and she started bursting out laughing like, ""What the heck? You look like you're getting ready for a work out!"". I was so embarrassed that I stuffed the boba wrap into the box and sent it back the same day. In my culture we use a similar wrap style but this product takes the cake on the most craziest type of wrap! Wrap your gut, over your shoulder, jam it inside your first wrap, wrap around your belly button and tie a knot!

I see many other carriers, where they can be tied and tucked away nicely but that can't be done with this one. Second is that the fabric is not breathable at all.

My newborn slides in perfectly and loves being so close all the time, and my toddler fits comfortably in it, however because he is so wiggly and loves to look/face forward, I will use a different carrier for him. The material feels like a comfortable tee shirt, but you wrap it around yourself three times so it can get very warm for you and baby if you don't dress and plan for wearing it.

According to instructions this is well within allowable weight to use the wrap but it is so stretchy that she slouches down. When I make it tight enough that she cant slouch, she gets uncomfortable and fusses. I am 5 ft 2, maybe that is an issue because I am small in proportion to my baby. But some people have said maybe it wasnt working for them because their baby was too big or too small.

While she didn't enjoy it immediately (she was not a fan of being restricted and having her head held down, even at one month), she did grow to like it more as she got a little bigger. Now she is five months and almost 18 pounds and we use the bigger carrier (Lille), but keep this around for certain occasions outlined below. It also took me a few tries until the wrapping procedure became second nature.Pros: better for smaller babies who don't fit well in larger carriers, easier to pack in a diaper bag, easy to keep on your body say while you drive so it's easier to take your baby around for errands without bumbling around with straps at home and again at your destination.Cons: thick fabric not ideal for warm summers, back support is not enough for prolonged use, hard not to get it on the ground when you're putting it on (which is fine at home, but kind of gross in say a parking lot), hard to find the perfect balance of tightness as it stretches a bit as you use it and baby starts to sag.In the end, we keep it for ease of packing and for short trips.

I like this wrap for hanging around the house and especially when my baby was a newborn.  I usually bounce on a yoga ball while doing some work on my laptop and he is really content!  He will sleep for hours esp if you are really pressed for time b/t feedings this wrap gives you extra time to do what you need b/c your baby will fall asleep in it and be very comfy.  The instructions for the wrap is to wear it very tightly so that the baby doesn't sag down but I found it more comfortable if I can look down and see the baby by wearing it looser.  It's very uncomfortable for me to wear it tightly b/c it presses against your breasts and if you are breastfeeding, esp the early days, it will be pretty uncomfortable and may lead to plugged ducts.I have tried this for walking and feel it is great for when the baby is a newborn but my son is now 17lbs and feel like I need to have one hand under him to support him esp when walking far.  Other than that wearing it around the house is fine for a larger baby.  As for chores around the house just do things you would do while you were pregnant.  I could fold clothes and do light chores that don't require bending.Here's a tip: so the baby can breath more easily and not breathing entirely in the wrap put one of his arms outside of one of the side panels and pull the bottom panel up over the arm.  His face will be free of breathing into the cloth. :) I also have a paci for him.

He falls asleep in about 10-15 min from being put in it if he's due for nap.I bought a Baby K'tan first and loved the concept but after about 20-30 min my back started hurting. I noticed the boba wrap ties lower on the back and offers some lumbar support. I have had this wrap for about a month and really like it. It took me a couple of tries to get the wrap tight enough to hold my son high enough but now it goes very quickly. The fabric is soft and stretchy but still sturdy.

"B005SP2LWW","A MUST Have For Any Mom (or Dad)!","Dooter","September 27, 2016",0,"Format: Baby Product",5,"I can't say enough positive things about my Boba wrap! After researching kangaroo care and many different wrap type products, I ordered this wrap (in light blue) in 2013 when pregnant with my first child. I decided on a wrap over other types of infant carriers due to the comfort for both myself and my baby, as well as gentleness, warmth & overall coziness of a simple sheet material. I chose my Boba wrap over a Moby because the Boba has a little bit more of a stretch to the material which I think is important for a great fit, comfort, and safety.I used this Boba to bring my infant son to work with me and taught classes with him snug and happy against my chest. I breast fed him while in my Boba at his demand; so very convenient. My son and I got to bond all day because of this wrap, so naturally I saved it for my next child. She loves it too!My daughter is now 7 months old (19 lbs) and she still loves being close to me in our Boba wrap. It is still comfortable for both of us to use. We started using it from birth as I did with my son and she breast feeds in it too. Freedom together, is the perfect motto for Boba wraps.If you want to get anything done around your house, you need a Boba wrap! If you are fortunate enough to have your baby with you all the time, you need a Boba wrap. Every mom (or dad) should have a Boba wrap.The wrap is easy to wash and also makes a handy wipe if you don't have a wipe or towel at your immediate disposal. The wrap is very sturdy and has handled numerous washes over the years and still looks like it did when I bought it. I absolutely love this product. I recommend it for all moms and dads.There is a small learning curve with putting on a Boba wrap but you can YouTube videos and learn from there. Make sure you pull the slack from it so your baby is secure and you should be able to kiss your baby's forehead while he/she is in it. Again, make sure you have it on securely and your baby's head is properly placed (and supported if he/she can't support it yet). Also, I stick my baby's legs/feet in the lowest part of the wrap that goes around my waist. I did not see this in the videos but it gives their legs support so they don't just hang or flop around. Spread the material that goes over your shoulders out as far as you can for maximum comfort.My personal guide to how I rate:Five Stars = best product I've tried in this field; will enthusiastically recommend to, or buy for, family and friends.

We've used this everywhere - around the house, running errands, going for walks, and even occasional napping. It's so convenient to carry anywhere and though it seemed complex at first to tie, it's really not once you watch the video online. My son stays still and will go almost anywhere when he's in it; unlike trying to tote him around in the stroller, he loves being close to me and we never have had a crying baby in public while he's in this. In fact, he stayed in it for 3 hours this past weekend while we walked around a festival, sleeping most of the time and only got out when I woke him up to eat then stayed content in it for the next couple hours we were there. I would recommend this to every new mom who needs free hands to do chores around home or wants to make running errands easy.

With my second baby I got him in and carried him around relatively okay for the two times that we did try it out. However, the other day I sat down and my husband next to me after a few minutes noticed that my baby was turning blue! I am not a big and busty person and I can't wear this wrap too tight, but somehow when I sat down my 3 week and 8lb old baby couldn't breathe. We immediately yanked him out and after what felt like an eternity he started breathing normally and then his color returned to normal. I was busy getting ready to take him to the ER while my mom who is a trained nurse tried to help him breathe again. This was an extremely scary experience. For this reason I cannot give this baby wrap anything more than one star or recommend it to anyone ever.To end, the pros are:1. Cheaper than other carriers2. Machine washable therefore easy to clean3. Small enough to place in diaper bag and travel with4. Baby is close to mommyHowever, they are outweighed by these cons:1. Not quick to put on2. Both my babies did not like the putting in and getting out. The one would settle down once he was in, but the other one continued to cry and fuss until I took him out.3. If you loosen it to try to accommodate a baby (less than 2 months old) that doesn't want to be in a carrier, you have to use your hands to support him, which renders this thing useless.4.

We live in San Diego. It's hot here. Now imagine wrapping a gigantic piece of fabric that is basically as hot as fleece around you 3 times and sticking your baby in there. It becomes a furnace. Wearing it outside is not an option. So I figured, I'd wear it inside with the AC on. I put the AC at 70, put my babe in it (infant and love my baby position), and within 5 minutes, we were both overheating (the baby was only wearing a diaper while I wore a loose t-shirt). I once wore it to the supermarket (cold!) and had to take her out and carry her on my shoulder because we all got too hot. I'm not sure how people wear this, walk around and be active, and not overheat. I am certainly not a person who is always hot, I'm actually one of those women who is always cold, so I know that's not the problem.

She is so content in this ""in utero"" type of position. Currently she is 6 weeks old and we have been using this almost daily since she was just a few days old. I picked this over other similar wraps because it has a bit of stretch to it, which allows you to tighten as tight as you please with the reassurance that baby will be able to fit because fabric will stretch to accomodate (others don't have that stretch aspect which may require frequent adjustments until you figure out how much slack you need).

Just keep in mind, it is really only good for newborns, because of the stretchy-ness of the fabric. With that in mind, with a little practice you can get a nice and tight wrap. It is great for keeping your baby close to you, and let's face it ALL babies love to be held and Loved on.  It is NOT for long term use though in my opinion. The material is just to stretchy, so as your baby gets older and bigger, the wrap will not stay as tight. I also think is is important to note that if you have a summer baby, this wrap keeps the heat in. I had a winter baby, so it worked well. Now that it is summer, we both just get to hot. It is NOT breathable. You can nurse in this wrap, again.. it just takes practice and patience. If this isn't the wrap for you, please do not give up on baby wearing, just try other options.  Boba has a video online that you can watch, I recommend watching it and practicing several times.

For one thing it's soft, supports the wobbly head, and provides body temperature while safely supporting the hip joint.  We continued that protocol in the daytime.  It's easy and comfortable.  Now that babies are 10+ pounds, I'm beginning to wonder about how long my spine/back will want the weight distributed across my back and shoulders vs on a hip belt.  Babies still love their ""Boba walks"" and the dog has accepted he no longer gets to sniff at his pace when we have babies strapped on.

"B005SP2LWW","Not for us.","Rachael Hart","June 2, 2016",0,"Format: Baby Product",3,"This is the first baby wearing carrier I ever purchased after my daughter was born. I specifically chose this particular wrap style carrier because:1) tiny newborn appropriate (my daughter was just 7.5 lbs at the time of purchase2) affordably priced (have you SEEN the $ on some of the carriers out there?)3) resembled the Moby wrap that every one raves about4) seemed adjustable so that multiple family members could use it5) machine washable - my baby is a spit-up machine6) easily accomodates a growing baby without requiring any special insertsHonestly, I'm torn about this carrier - yes, it is nice, but I'm only inclined to use it about the house. Why? Mostly because it is so time consuming to put on, and I feel that if I don't wrap it about me just right, it's not snug enough. When it's not snug enough, my daughter sags down into the pocket, much farther down my torso than recommended - then I can't listen for her breathing. When I DO get it snug enough, it's almost as if her breathing is heavier and she wheezes. All these complications may simply be ""user error"", though I have devoted quite a bit of time to ""practicing"" putting it on and wearing her about the house for short periods of time. I can't IMAGINE having to wrap this carrier on after arriving at the store to make shopping more convenient. If anything, it would be more time consuming to wrap it about me as there would be no mirror available to check and be sure the wrap is not twisted about my back. I definetly would not be reaching for this particular style of carrier out of convenience. I grab my Rockin' Baby Sling pouch for that! Additionally, while the jersey material is SO soft and washes well, having yards and yards of it wrapped about you and baby in the FL heat is torture.Perhaps there are other care-givers out there more adept at quickly and efficiently wrapping up in their carriers, but I'm not one of them, unfortunately.

A dear friend bought it for me, and I did use it, but ultimately it's just ok.Here's the deal. It's big. Bulky. Cumbersome. It's not difficult to put on, but there is a learning curve and it does take a minute or so, which is a long time with a screaming baby. It also takes up honestly about half of the space in my diaper bag, if not more, so it generally stays at home. Baby was generally ok with it, but I wasn't that impressed. I also have a beco Gemini, and ended up not bothering with the giant wrap and it sat in its pouch.I ended up trying a baby ktan and like it much better because it is faster and much less bulky, meaning I'll use it more, and it's still as snuggly as a wrap. I also have an SF Giants themed moby wrap-- it's bright orange so I generally only wear it on game days. I noticed no significant difference between the boba and moby.Long story short, be prepared for the time and physical space that this requires.

When you walk around, the bouncing motion lulls them to sleep.  You can also pull one flap over their head to protect their head from the sun if you are outdoors.  When our daughter gets hungry,she'll start smaking her lips, and I can actually feed her her bottle hands free by putting it under one of the shoulder flaps.This is actually how most cultures in human history have cared for their infants.

It also helps you get things done because your hands can be free.I really can't say enough good things about this wrap. It fit both my husband and I (I'm 5'5"" and he is 6'1"" both good shape). It does get pretty hot in this sometimes but that's to be expected. Once on its easy to adjust to the tightness you prefer. It's quite stretchy (more so than the Moby Wrap) and I prefer it that way so it doesn't feel so tight and rigid. It washes easily and is very soft. This is a MUST have for anyone with a new baby.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFIA6GD3625U66C6J3UTULGTBK2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFIA6GD3625U66C6J3UTULGTBK2Q"

In my sleep-deprived stupor, I thought this would be too complicated for me to put on and these days I'm all about quick and easy!  Well, i don't don't know if it was a growth spurt or what, but at about 2.5 weeks, my baby was super fussy all the time and didn't want to be put down. It was exhausting! I couldn't even eat anything that required using more than one hand. Then I remembered this wrap that I had returned and decided to try it again. I already had the infantino newborn carrier and Bjorn carrier, but they aren't built to soothe a baby. Mine didn't mind going for walks in the others, but only the Boba INSTANTLY soothed baby and put her to sleep for hours! Oh man, I love this thing.The material is soft and super stretchy. It is kind of thick but I have been on walks with it in 85 degree weather and not been too hot. I prefer the look of the grey but I bought the black to hide the stains that me and baby would inevitably get on this thing (spit up, salad dressing and poop are just a few of the things hidden on this thing so far).At 10 weeks, I still use this almost daily and we love it. Baby is 12 lbs and I'm still carrying her around very easily in the Boba.  Great purchase!Tip: if you're nervous about tying this thing, just watch a couple of videos about tying methods. You'll be a pro after a few attempts. Also, keep close eye on baby's face to make sure she's never nuzzled too closely.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AED5JFC4UPDYUW4POLFUR7NBQIKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AED5JFC4UPDYUW4POLFUR7NBQIKA"

The wrap itself is great quality and the price is fair. However, had I known that she would get too warm too fast to actually get anything done, I would have opted for the Ergo or something similar right away. If you aren't worried about being too warm and want a nice wrap to wear around the house or shopping then this is the way too go. It's also very easy to breastfeed in and perfect for newborns who love the warmth. Before getting warm made her uncomfortable, my daughter would fall asleep as soon as she was in the wrap due to hearing the familiarity of mom's heartbeat and the security of being snuggled close.

Then I can position his head to make it hands free (awesome!). It has taken me a little while to get used to putting it on, but it's not too difficult. I watched a video online which helped. Another reviewer mentioned the tip of putting the wrap on before you get in the car when you go places (great idea!). It can be a little stretchy at times so you have to make sure to put it on tight enough so you don't feel like the baby is falling down. It's very long (I'm fairly short at 5'3"") but I figure it's good for my husband who is taller.

However, I had one from my first baby (this is #4) when these were still called Sleepy Wraps.  I finally had to get rid of that one :( since it was falling apart after 3 kids and 7 years.  I tried to replace it with a Moby, but I really did not like it AT ALL.  This has a little more stretch so it is easier to get a good fit.  It took me a few tries to really get the tying right and a few weeks before I really ""perfected it"".  If you buy one and it doesn't work out the first time -- try, try again!  Go watch some YouTube videos demonstrating tying it!  One trick is to pull it very tight - as tight as you can get it.  It stretches when baby is in there (that's what I had trouble with the Moby).  I love baby wearing (and did it before it got so popular -- hipster mom LOL).  And I unfortunately cannot buy every wrap/carrier on the market (and some are crazy expensive!).  This one is so great and by far my favorite for little ones!  I'm also using it while I'm pregnant to wrap my belly for support -- google belly wrapping with a Boba wrap :)  One other great benefit -- it spread the weight of your baby around your whole back and hips.  As someone with shoulders that seem to tire easily (or just start hurting) with back pack straps or other carrier straps, this is awesome.

"B005SP2LWW","Great wrap","Michelle Francis","May 3, 2016",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"I'm a little obsessed with finding the perfect wrap....Love this wrap!  The stretch is nice so baby can move around a little bit.  Stretch is also useful to maneuver baby for nursing.  Fabric is on the thicker side so a little warm, but not too bad In general unless warm outside or in the sun.  After a few times I'm now able to get it on and baby in it within a minute, and comfy for several hours!  And at 7 wks she lulls quickly to sleep with the motion.  (Just make sure to have good posture and use your core, as with any wrap!).I also have the ktan and like this one better over all (ktan not too bad but less stretch.  Can get the ktan on super fast though!)Maya wrap is nice too and can get her in it quickly, but I need to experiment with other positions now that she's getting bigger.  It also shows lint horribly so get a light color if you try the Maya ring sling.  Boba >> Maya/K'tan.Sollybaby.com has a thinner version of the boba with slightly less stretch and gorgeous color options!  Boba = Solly...different perks to each.  Solly is pictured in the black... Boba in turquoise.Last but not least.... MeeYoo brand (on Facebook) is gorgeous and handmade in my hometown by my cousins!

When I first received the wrap and tried wrapping the first time (I watched a video on YouTube on how to wrap it on me), I became skeptical about the product. My baby kind of sagged in the product. I kept wrapping and wrapping---practice makes perfect, right!? Anyways, after several and several tries I began to have my doubts. The whole wrapping situation can get you frustrated. Even, trying to put your baby in it. I even got to the point and mentioned possibly returning it. I had a friend tell me she loved hers so I decided to keep on trying. I was new to the baby wrap. I never used it with my other children. I finally found my solution to my issue. You kind of have to be aggressive and make sure you wrap as tightly as possible. Once I put my baby in it, she fell asleep. I gave this product four stars mainly due to the struggling issue I had at first with it. It's a struggle and takes practice.

"B005SP2LWW","Comfortable for baby and parents!","Anon.","May 2, 2016",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"Why did it take me until my second baby to buy one of these? I love it. I already owned an Ergobaby, which I absolutely loved and used a bunch, but when I had my second baby I was spending a lot of time playing on the floor with the toddler or sitting down for meals, etc. while still holding the newborn. With the Ergo, it's not comfortable to sit down. But the Boba solved that. It's very comfy for the baby and works magic when it comes to putting the baby to sleep. Two downsides: 1) I live in California where it's warm most of the time. It does get warm wearing the Boba both for me and the baby. I have to plan our outfits accordingly. (I did look into some of the mesh wraps, but most of the reviews said they weren't as comfortable and would roll up); 2) even though it's pretty quick to put on, like other reviewers have noted, it can seem like forever when your baby is screaming/crying. I'd say it takes about 30 seconds, but sure can feel like eternity with a crying kid! I did figure out that if I'm going somewhere I can put the wrap on at home, drive with it and just keep it on until I want or need to put the baby in it. I should note that the main reason I chose the Boba over other wraps was because of the color choices. The other brands didn't have the light blue/turquoise color I was looking for.

After following along on the video one time I can now tie it quickly and easily. The material is so soft and comfy. My baby loves being in the wrap. He went right to sleep the minute I put him in. I was afraid it wouldn't feel secure but I feel 100% comfortable with him in it hands free and when tied properly I know he is secure and will not fall out. The only complaint I can think of is that it does get a little hot but I think that's a given with any wrap considering two peoples body heat pressed closely together.

I have already purchased and received as gifts a few wraps and slings that I had not been happy with. After reading the reviews on this wrap I felt that this would be a good choice to carry around my six week old daughter. What actually happened was I was not confident in my ability to properly wear the wrap as the instructions toward the end were pretty confusing! I couldn't figure out how to cross the weap behind my back as they said in the instruction manual it without it twisting and turning.So even though I couldn't follow the instructions to a t because the wrap was so long and it was practically impossible for it not to get twisted I wrapped it around my body the best way I could. The problem came when I put my daughter in it and she seemed really secure but I noticed right away that she began to overheat. It was definitely pretty toasty with her wrapped up so closely and tightly to my chest with even only wearing a diaper. Of course,  when my daughter's temperature started to rise it she in turn made me hot so before we both became a sweaty mess?  Off it went!So overall my complaints are the instructions which to me were pretty confusing and the fact that the material didn't offer a lot of room to breathe. Finally, the amount of time it took to put it on, this is definitely not something that you can easily get in and out of. When you plan on using a wrap when you're out on the road you're not going to have a lot of time to try to figure this out from the time you get from the car trying to get to where you're going so overall I like the idea this but it just didn't work for me.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGCXNXZZQS3B56HYZMFZ5XI3YTTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGCXNXZZQS3B56HYZMFZ5XI3YTTA"

"B005SP2LWW","Good product but not for everyone","Amazon Customer","April 16, 2016",1,"Format: Baby Product",3,"My husband and I picked out this carrier, mainly because it was affordable and had a good reputation.  Some cheaper less wrap-like carriers are associated with hip problems, so we didn't want those.  I was hesitant about the elaborate process of wrapping it around me, but it gets easier over time.  It's still a bit of a hassle though and I'm not sure it's really worth it.Pros:1) The baby seems to like being in the boba.  When she was first born, the boba wrap was one of the few things that made her quiet down and was the only way we could take her anywhere.  But now that she's getting more comfortable in her stroller, the boba is getting less appealing.2) There's pretty good back support.  The weight of the baby is fairly evenly distributed so you can carry her around for awhile without too much back pain.3) It's nice to be able to carry the baby around and still have your hands free.  You can even use it just doing chores around the house if you have a baby that wants to be held all the time but you need to vacuum or something like that.4) It's cheap, easy to clean, and light weight - after all, it's basically just a giant strip of stretchy fabric.Cons:1) I'm constantly paranoid that she's going to suffocate in there.  She's still too small to hold up her head so I try to support her head with part of the wrap, but then I'm constantly fussing with it to make sure her face isn't pressed into the fabric or my boobs.2) It's hot!  I guess this happens anytime you strap another person to your body, but the weather is getting warmer and it's just too hot to walk around outside with her in it.3) The wrap is ridiculously long.  After following the wrapping instructions, you're left with feet and feet of fabric and you can either have a giant tail or wrap it around your waist a million more times.4) It's kinda a pain to deal with the wrapping.  It takes a little while to put on and then you have to maneuver a wiggly baby into it.  Where we live, you pretty much have to drive everywhere, so running errands with the boba involves constantly moving the baby from car seat to wrap.  It's much easier just to take out the car seat and click it into the stroller.5) Even if you can get the baby to fall asleep in the boba, you will never get them to stay asleep when you take them out.  My husband always compares taking her out of the boba to giving birth - very traumatizing.6) When the baby gets sick of it, she starts screaming and clawing at me with her tiny little talons.Overall it's a fairly good product, but it's not for everyone.  If you're really into wearing your baby and do a lot of walking, then you might really like this.  Also it's a nice way to give you husband an idea of what it was like lugging a baby around your midsection for 9 months - although it's not really the same since it doesn't come with nausea, heartburn, exhaustion, ect.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHPVKPYGBREN57R7RAMA6LEX6NCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHPVKPYGBREN57R7RAMA6LEX6NCA"

It takes a while to learn how to wrap it correctly (had to practice a lot at home before attempting it while out and about). Some cons: the wrap does brush on the ground and get dirty when putting it on, no matter how hard I try to hold all the material (but there's a lot), it doesn't quite support my infants head as well as my Ergobaby with infant insert - I find that I have to hold his head because the material doesn't hold it well enough, which can be hard at times if I'm grocery shopping, cleaning, or doing other errands. The good: material is soft and stretchy, easy to clean, wrap comes with a carry pouch (though it's hard for me to fold it up nice enough to fit back in there when on the go). I do try to put the wrap on at home and then go, so I don't have to mess with the tying and wrapping when out (esp if baby is getting fussy after being in the car seat). Overall I'm glad I got this as another carry option for my baby. He seems comfortable in it and loves being on my chest, esp if he's starting to work himself up.

"B005SP2LWW","This is a great product that is better than we imagined!","KatieJon","March 13, 2016",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"After doing some research to decide if we wanted a Boba or Moby wrap, we decided on the Boba because of the stretch in the fabric. Very happy we chose this one! I found the initial idea of learning to use the wrap confusing... BUT in reality it is very (very!) simple. I found how-to videos on the Boba website and on YouTube and within fifteen minutes I was up to speed and had my newborn in the Boba doing skin-to-skin. This wrap also allows me to have (partial) hands-free time to get chores done (dishes, making bottles, vacuuming, folding laundry, etc) while keeping my son happy and content. I'm currently a 1X-2X and this allows for plenty of fabric to accommodate larger sizes (with plenty to spare), while my significant other is very small and it works just as well on him! As an added bonus, if I go outside for some fresh air it keeps well-meaning, enthusiastic people from touching my newborn (and passing on germs). We love this wrap so much that we purchased a second one to have on hand when one is being laundered!  (We own in in Sangria and Gray - both lovely!). Each wrap comes with a small carry bag made out of the same material. Oddly enough, the first wrap we purchased came with a convenient elastic to synch the bag closed, the second one we purchased did not come with a way to close the bag (see photo). We strongly recommend this product to parents and have been very satisfied with the product! As an added note: when using the Boba to carry my son, we kick-up a lot of heat! I would LOVE to see this company make a version of this wrap with a sturdy, yet light-weigh mesh or muslin (still with stretch) to use during the hot summer months. That would be a product we would purchase right away!",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHAQVG44CIQBYM5ELPI2HXWFNAUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHAQVG44CIQBYM5ELPI2HXWFNAUA"

My daughter sometimes doesn't like the baby Ktan and I thought it might be that she's getting too squished, so having an adjustable size wrap would help her get more comfortable. The Boba wrap fabric is thick and stretchy. I ordered the purple and it is a kind of bright violet, not a royal purple. The wrap is easy enough to tie once you get the hang of it, but it still takes longer than the baby Ktan to put on. I think overall it is more comfortable than the baby Ktan because the weight is distributed around your waist as well as on your shoulders. The drawback is really the time it takes to put it on. My baby likes this one just as much as the Ktan. One thing to note is that you cannot do forward facing in the Boba wrap, which I did not know until after I purchased it.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGKKKLV6CEWKDC2T4Z2VT73ZFQHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGKKKLV6CEWKDC2T4Z2VT73ZFQHQ"

However, I do have to list the drawbacks of this wrap. First, it is incredibly long and thus quite difficult to maneuver when trying to tie it. What I've found that makes it a little easier to use outside the home is tying it on me before leaving the house then when we get where we're going, I take baby out of the car seat and put her in the wrap. Second, like others have said, it traps heat. I have the black wrap so the color may be a contributing factor, but it definitely makes baby and I quite warm. Lastly, while I've read and seen tutorial videos about the possibility of nursing in this wrap, it is definitely not as easy as I had hoped. Maybe a little more practice will help, we shall see.

"B005SP2LWW","This is a life saver","PrincessRofAmazon","February 19, 2016",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"I'm gonna have to rant and rave about this wrap because, honestly, it's the best thing since sliced bread. I just gave birth a couple of weeks ago and, as expected, there are times when my baby simply wants to snuggle with mama. Thing is, I still have other things to do around the house and I'm a full time student, which means I do need my hands. Before the boba wrap, I tried a regular Infantino carrier. That didn't work at all tho because it's too bulky, the baby's weight is all concentrated on the lower body, making my hips and c section cut scream from pain, and my baby was sweating bullets. So I looked on Amazon (all new moms' best friend) and found their best selling wrap, the Boba wrap. I asked my mommy friends about their experience with it and everyone was raving, saying it was the best helping hand they had with their newborn. So I got it. I was sorta skeptical because putting it on looked like black magic from the videos I saw- twist it here, wrap it there, flip it this way- but I still want for it because the potential benefit would outweigh the possible risk of not being able to put it on. And I'm glad I did. I only had to put it on twice to remember how to do it and my baby livres it. Only  downfalls I've found so far are: it seems to get loose pretty quicky; and baby can get too warm snuggled up so close for extended amounts of time. However, the first could be my fault- a friend of mine told me she had to wrap it really really tight in order for it to not get loose; the second is pretty standard for all carriers I've tried- two human beings together snuggled up like a sandwich have a really high chance of getting warm. Also, when you open the wrap, you may think it's too long; it's not. By the time you wrap it around your body, you have enough to tie it on your side to secure it. Go for it, this is totally worth every penny.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEN3ZCP4V5MLDHMWS7EDDPREOU7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEN3ZCP4V5MLDHMWS7EDDPREOU7Q"

Rowley","February 6, 2016",1,"Format: Baby Product",4,"I bought this because the sizing on the baby k'tan carriers didn't really work for me-- I was annoyingly between sizes. I'd heard good things about this wrap-- the learning curve was not too steep and it was pretty versatile. I haven't used it a ton since I've only had it for a couple of weeks now and it's been snowy and so I have been pretty housebound, but it's been pretty easy the few times I've tried it out. My son is growing pretty rapidly, so I'm not sure how much longer I'll be comfortable, but so far he fits pretty well and my back doesn't feel it. I'm careful to make sure that I've wrapped it tight enough and that the straps are wide across my back and shoulders. My main regret with the boba wrap is that I didn't buy it before he was born so I could have started wearing him in the beginning. Instead, I got this when he was about six weeks old and I feel like I have to get him used to the idea of baby wearing...ETA- My son is now 7 months old. I stopped using the Boba wrap when he was about 5 months old because it was just too bouncy with his weight (he was about 15 pounds when I stopped wearing him). However, I LOVED this wrap before that. I vastly preferred wearing him in the wrap to the stroller because we were both much more content (he cried less and I was more confident in knowing how he was doing). He also fell asleep probably 75% of the time I wore him for longer than 20 minutes, which is kind of a great thing when you need to be sure of a nap. I loved the stretchiness of the fabric in the beginning, but that was part of why I quit wearing it and switched to the ergobaby (which I now also love, but it's less convenient than a wrap in a lot of ways!). I would always put the wrap on really tight and then stretch it for my son to fit in pretty snug. I only felt like it was a little too tight two, maybe three, times. Not a real issue. I also loved being able to put the wrap on ahead of time-- before going in the car, etc-- where other style carriers have to be put on pretty much at the same time you're planning on wearing your baby. I am definitely keeping this wrap around in case of another baby, though I've also heard that solly wraps are better in warm weather (we get SOOO SWEATY while baby wearing! it's kind of disgusting sometimes).",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEZ522TGWBBEV737JMVLJEWLD3IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEZ522TGWBBEV737JMVLJEWLD3IQ"

I've only had an uncomfortable Bjorn carrier before, and it killed my back.  For my second baby, I wanted a comfy way to carry my high-needs son while nursing when needed.  The fabric is nice and stretchy and seems very sturdy, but I was pretty boggled when trying to figure out how to wear it.  The learning curve on these fabric wraps is steep...there is a ton of fabric dragging around on the ground (picking up dust bunnies!) and I had to watch several videos on youtube before I got it right and tight.  There were some tears of frustration, for sure.  Once I got it tight enough to feel ok putting my 5 week old son in, I realized how annoying actually putting the baby in was.  The fabric has to be tight for security, but that makes putting your baby in one leg at a time very hard.  He cried from me trying to maneuver him around all the folds.  I was also never able to get him low enough to ever make nursing a possibility.  But because it was comfy for me, I wanted to keep it for long walks, etc.  Then the deal breaker was when I tried to get him out.  Say your baby falls asleep while in the wrap and you want to put him down - there is no way to get a light sleeper out of this thing without waking them unless you unwrap it around them, which I wasn't comfortable with for safety.  So, when I thought about how long it takes to origami this carrier together and insert my baby while he's crying, I decided to return for a more comfortable and easy structured carrier that my husband could use, too.  I also didn't like the thought of having to go through the wrap process over and over again throughout the day.

As another reviewer stated, once it's on and baby is in, it's great - but the process of getting to that point is not only extremely confusing but also very frustrating to learn.  As a new mom who's already frustrated with the ins and outs of getting used to the change that is managing a house and a newborn, I cringe to tell that nearly every time I tried to put this on I ended up crying and giving up.  After several of these attempts and an instructional video found on facebook, I finally got the hang of it...but it was still something I had to do, undo, and redo before I got anywhere close to putting my baby in.  And my baby likes it - for about ten minutes, the time it takes her to overheat.  And this is in the dead of winter in central Pennsylvania, with a baby only 10 pounds.  I couldn't imagine when she gets bigger in the summer.  Overall, if you've used one before or have taken a class on how to use it, it could be great.

My 10-week cries like mad anytime he's put down so this wrap allows us both to stay happy and sane while I go about my business. I read some negative reviews saying that baby bounced around or they didn't feel like baby was secure. I guess not all wraps work for everyone but that's never been an issue for me. Baby is nice and snug against my chest and I can keep his head positioned so his airways are clear. He takes solid hour and a half naps in the carrier and wakes up happy and refreshed. When I get up in the morning I get dressed and immediately tie on the Boba wrap so I can easily get baby inside when he starts to fuss or get tired. I've worn my first baby wrap so much that I just ordered a second. Baby tends to drool on the fabric a bit and spits up sometimes so when one goes in the wash I can have another on standby. I use it THAT much!Some people have found a way to nurse while wearing the carrier. I've managed this once but I had to be sitting down and really struggle to get us both in the right position.

They are made from a high quality stretch cloth that allows you to wear your baby in a tight and safe way. There are so many different ways that you can wear your baby.

Any of the you tube videos for the moby wraps can be down with these wraps.  The wraps are light weight enough that they can be used in all weather. If it is cold outside you can just dress your baby in layers before wearing him of her in the summer they stay cool enough to be comfortable.  I have worn my youngest under a large coat in the winter then running errands that way I could have them covered when running in and out of stores. The color of this wrap really does go with anything and can be used for a boy or girl. These wraps are really versatile and easy to use once you get the hang of it. I really find that my babies like to be worn because they feel safe and secure. The advantage for the mommy is being able to use her hands while wearing her little one.

I wore my preemie daily in the wrap from the time he came home until six months. I can still continue to wear him comfortably in the wrap, but because of the winter weather I found a borrowed buccal type carrier easier to put on in the cold parking lot.  Ofcourse, if planned ahead, I can always put wrap on before leaving house and put baby in at the parking lot.  I have also found, with more strength my little guy moves more and the stretch in the boba makes me feel less secure than earlier times and less secure than him presently in the buccal carrier. However, in contrast to the buccal carrier, the boba wrap continues to feel and look more natural and less like a baby backpack.  Bottomline... the price, soft material, and comfort for both me and baby, hands down, make this my favorite and most used baby purchase.

"B005SP2LWW","Most fabulous carrier out there for the first few months of baby's life!","amazonshopperhouston","December 8, 2015",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"We purchased a hotsling, a babybjoern, an ergobaby with infant insert and about two weeks into our daughters life a boba wrap. This is our third baby and I really wish I had know about the boba wrap with our two older kids.Our third baby is colicky, it can be aweful - she has bouts of crying that seem unstoppable and it's as if she is in pain. The absolutely only thing that will get her out of her crying mode within less than a couple of minutes in 100% of cases is the bobawrap. She already calms down when we slide her into it, and often falls asleep within minutes. If it was up to her, she would be inside the bobawrap 10 hours a day. I highly recommend the wrap for families with high need babies or infants that cry a lot, it's been a life saver for us.POSITIVES ABOUT BOBA: Tying is less complex than it looks - watch the youtube video rather than relying on the instructions. You can keep the wrap on even when you are not ""wearing"" baby, almost like an extra layer or a poncho : ) Baby is really close to you and feels your body warmth and hears your voice, and is jiggled around whenever you move (slightly, not violently). In colder climates, the Boba keeps you and baby nicely warm. In comparison to most other carriers, the Boba is inexpensive and baby's weight is nicely distributed across your back/shoulders (if you tie correctly and spread the fabric well across your entire back). It's washable like a sweater and the material is soft. In comparison to the sling carriers (hotslings), it's much easier on your back and baby feels much more tightly tucked in.NEGATIVES: I don't think it's that easy to breastfeed while the wrap is on, and once it's off you have to find a semi-clean space to tie it on again (you don't want the wrap that goes right around baby's face to touch airport floors or public bathrooms), which takes a coupe of minutes longer than tying/untying babybjoern or ergobaby carriers. In hot climates, you are likely to get pretty warm in the boba wrap.Altogether, if you are going to buy only a single carrier for the first six to eight months, get this one! I am so grateful since without the BobaWrap our infant's crying spells would be lengthy and unbearable.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFWDWFISI6EXBLEUH5BSKCXTTMJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFWDWFISI6EXBLEUH5BSKCXTTMJQ"

That aside, I give five stars for: appearance and ease of use. If I'm going out shopping or to the in-laws or whatever, this is the wrap I bring along.

I love that it stretches just a bit, but can be wrapped snug so babies can't fall out the side. It feels very secure and comfortable and allows you to be totally hands free. It is adjustable so lots of different body types can wear it, husbands, caretakers etc. I had to watch the video a few times to learn how to put it on and it does take a minute to get it on right, but it is always worth the wait.

I found that I have to put the wrap on nice and snug to keep my baby from drooping. You may feel like keeping it loose in order to put baby inside, but the material is very stretchy, so put it on snugly (not too tight, obviously).

"B005SP2LWW","You need this.","Clarissa Hawkins","October 26, 2015",0,"Format: Baby Product",5,"Baby wraps are AMAZING. Immediately puts my baby into a deep sleep no matter how tired/upset she is, AND I can get so much done while she is in her wrap- hands free! If you tie the wrap properly you definitely don't need to support the baby with your hands, as some other reviews state... they clearly aren't tying it tight enough. Don't be afraid to tie the wrap really tight, your baby likes to be squeezed tight! Her head stays up no problem, and she doesn't have a problem breathing. It is also very simple to tie, I only had to look at the directions once and haven't had a problem. Every once and a while I do have to readjust her body from outside of the wrap if she starts to slide down after a couple of hours of walking around, but it isn't inconvenient to do so.I used this yesterday to travel in the airport & airplane ALONE (just my newborn and I) and now I feel obligated to review. My baby slept the entire time I was in the airport and on the airplane, BOTH ways on my round trip. It keeps all of the germs off of her and keeps her sooo calm, even with all of the loud announcements on the airplane. You don't have to take the baby out through security, you can use the bathroom alone without any struggling, you have your hands free to carry a diaper bag (I carried a backpack), and you don't have to even worry about dealing with a stroller. Just popped her in the wrap when I got dropped at the curb, and kept her in there until I got picked up at the curb at my destination.

"B005SP2LWW","VERY easy, comfortable, and secure.","Schultz","October 26, 2015",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"Love love love. Super easy to use (after I looked up a video on YouTube that is... Took me one try after that and now I'm like a pro), very comfortable, and baby loves it. He sleeps everywhere we go when he is carried in it. I live in a very hot environment and he wasn't any hotter in the wrap than he would have been out of it. I actually liked that I could keep him close to me so I could keep an eye on his body temperature better than if he was in a car seat or something. We don't have strangers trying to touch him when he is in the wrap, and the ends work as a built in burp rag to wipe his mouth if he spits up a little while I am wearing it. It is great, I can go grocery shopping or to the park with him in the wrap, and I don't have a car seat to lug around. If he gets fussy in the wrap, I'm already holding him to comfort him so I don't have to take him out of a car seat and lug an empty car seat around. Compared to my first baby where we carried a car seat and diaper bag around everywhere we went, this is much easier and WAY less stressful. I like the stretchy fabric because it's definitely a one size fits all. Anyone of any size can use this wrap for their baby. It also grows with my baby, three months using it and he still fits just right. I don't feel like it sags or doesn't hold him well - it is completely up to you how tightly your baby is wrapped! As long as I tighten it the right amount for me and my baby before I put him in we are both secure and comfortable. Its very easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone having a baby - it really makes life with a baby much easier and comfortable, for mom and baby!

My daughter is 2.5 weeks old, and is going through a stage where she is just starting to get distracted by things and wanting to stay awake forever.. The result is that she only wants to sleep while being held. I've tried the swing, a cradle, letting her cry... Nothing keeps her asleep more than an hour during the day. My husband puts her in a regular carrier, and she sleeps really well, but the carrier was way too complicated for me to put her in by myself. We've been doing the pick me up and change me, feed me, put me to sleep and start it all over again in 30 minutes dance for several days - till yesterday. The Boba wrap came. I practiced tying a few times while baby fussed in her swing. The directions are a little tricky, but it's not hard to tie once you understand them. Just look closely at the pictures.  The second time I tied it I felt confident enough to give it a try. Out came fussy baby from the swing, I slid her into the wrap and her reaction was ""Waaahhhhsnoooooorrrre!"" She didn't even finish getting out a whole yell before she fell asleep! A miracle! I've been wearing her in the Boba for several hours.  She fell asleep almost as soon as I put her in it. She loves the fact that she is right up against me, and so do I. It feels like holding her in a snuggly blanket - except I get to eat my lunch and type this review while using it!  I love having her close enough to kiss her while I get stuff done, I don't feel like she is shut up alone in a room all day now. Not to mention it's great for that mommy paranoia - is she breathing? Is she ok? I just lean down and listen, and I can hear her snoring away.

The fabric itself is very soft, and it even comes with a little bag that you can wad it up and put it in to take with you (and it doubles as a nice little ""pillow"" while in the bag if you need one!). The Boba wrap will stretch a little because there is some spandex, while the Moby is 100% cotton and doesn't stretch at all.  To me, the stretchiness of the Boba wrap is a major plus, because when I started out with my Moby, I could never get it situated so that my daughter was in the right position.  I never have had this issue with the Boba.  My daughter is almost up to 18 pounds now, and she still likes to ride in this.  You can carry your little one up to 35 lbs in this wrap.Also, this is really wonderful if you have a cranky baby; I have heard mothers who have colicky babies say how much this wrap helped.  This was a lifesaver for me when my daughter had her first round of vaccinations, because she got really fussy and wanted to be held the whole time.  Not only did she settle down once I put her in the wrap, but she actually fell asleep and got some much needed rest.Don't be intimidated by trying to get the wrap on you the correct way; there is a bit of a learning curve, but the Boba company has some very helpful videos to help you figure out how to wrap yourself up, plus there are lots of videos on Youtube.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFAH5FDDNEF7STSU7LVJQCM7Z6OQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFAH5FDDNEF7STSU7LVJQCM7Z6OQ"

The warmth that they felt, is gone.  The security they crave for being tucked doesn't feel the same. But the Boba Wrap offers this security and warmth.My baby felt most calm in the wrap. Because of the elasticity, I wasnt afraid she'd suffocate from the pressure other wraps may give. But don't be fooled that though it's elasticity prevent suffocation, it still kept her neatly tucked and she didn't jostle like other babies my experience from other carriers. And that's why I love it.My baby grew with this wrap. As a newborn, she was tucked in a fetal position to make sure her spine wasn't feeling pressure like other carriers do by holding by the bum. The way it wraps around her also kept her warm.My LO is now 6 months old/19 lbs and I still use it. I can even breastfeed her by pulling the ends to give more room for her to scoot down. It's an easy clean through the washer and dryer. My sisters even say that it looks like a fashionable top so I don't feel weird walking around in it if she's in someone else's hands.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHHI4MWYAW56X4XNKKT3N4BM6DTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHHI4MWYAW56X4XNKKT3N4BM6DTA"

Most importantly, my baby loved it. I highly recommend to any new parent.The only downside is because the fabric is so stretchy, it can sag if it's not tied tightly enough.

Also, unless you tie it and wear it before leaving the house, it seems kind of unrealistic to tie it once you get somewhere- the fabric is extremely long and would be all over the floor and whatever else.  It also seemed to always loosen up no matter what- not so much that my baby would fall out, but enough to just make it sort of uncomfortable for both of us.

I did extensive research on the best baby wearing gear and arrived at the decision to try this wrap. The length is absolutely unreasonable! IF you are out and about and want to put this on, you will be dragging the material on the ground. I live in SF and the ground is gross here, so I cannot imagine trying to put this on while outside. If you put it on at home and then wear it around until the baby is ready to go in, then maybe you'd have a chance... but who wants to wear 5+ yards of fabric when there's no baby inside. One day i put the baby in to carry him to the car, then when I put him in his carseat i took one of the shoulder straps off... hoping to preserve the  wrap for when we arrived at our destination... when we got there i couldn't tell which strap i had taken off and i'm pretty sure I ended up putting the strap that was supposed to go around my waist up on my shoulder. So... it's complicated to deal with.The fabric is very nice and thick.. it's a bit stretchy, which makes it good in some ways and not to good in others. The baby felt very secure with the thickness of the fabric, but the stretch of the fabric caused his little head to bounce when we we walking (and yes, i had it wrapped very tightly). I also noticed that the wrap would start to sag even after wearing it while seated - we weren't walking or putting any stress on the wrap and yet it still started to loosen.If there was a baby k'tan made out of this material, then i would have arrived at the perfect baby carrier...but that doesn't exist. In the end, I made my own baby k'tan out of thick sweatshirt material that had some lycra in it.

I chickened out, but a month later for my babies' first pediatrician visit, I decided to give it a go... and now I can't see myself running any errand without it! It's way easier than having to carry my entire click and connect stroller system, especially when it's something fast (although let's face it, no errand is fast anymore once you have a baby).

When I try to stick him in it he just starts sliding down and I'm afraid with as much moving as he does he is going to flop right out of the thing.  I'm debating if I am going to return it or ask someone who has experience wearing their baby if I am even tying this stupid thing right, which I'm pretty sure I am.  But as of right now I'm not really impressed with the product.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE6DGORHRNX3XJ6BYJHJCOICYLXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AE6DGORHRNX3XJ6BYJHJCOICYLXA"
"B005SP2LWW","Cant say enough great things sbout it","Taryn","August 28, 2015",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"I purchased this before my son was born. With my daughter, I had used Moby Wrap and with him I figured I would try the Boba wrap to see if there was any difference. The biggest difference in my observation is that the Moby wrap is slightly thinner fabric. So if it were me, I would purchase the Boba wrap for a Fall/Winter baby or just a generally mild temperatured climate. Our son was born the 25th of August, and it works great for us.I cannot say how much I love this wrap. If I had gone without it, I'm not sure how we would have made it. Baby wearing, for both my babies was the key to happy babies and thus a happy home. I love that it's lightweight and easy to pack away without taking too much room up. I'm not one who likes to pack heavy. I also LOVE that it is so easily washable. You just throw it in the wash and you're done. I like the navy color as well because I wanted something that my husband would be comfortable wearing as well and didn't draw too much attention.My son loves being in the Boba wrap. I think it's great that it mimics their time in the womb with a snug warm place to cuddle up in, and in addition, they were used to feeling the away back and forth when their Mama walked and they get Rhett same sensation while being in the wrap. It's an instant calming technique for my son. I loved it so much I got it for a friend for her habit shower too. This will be my go-to baby gift because I know it will be loved.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFIQD2FX5OHBPFI2TC4N4IDCKPDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFIQD2FX5OHBPFI2TC4N4IDCKPDQ"

I decided to research baby wraps as I just had triplets (yes you read that right!) and never had a moment without a precious bundle in my arms. I love holding my babies, its just that my arms would feel weak after an hour or so and nothing much else got done. I ordered this one cause the reviews looked good and so did the product. I was more than a bit skeptical to say the least. Fast forward a few weeks. My babies are in love with this as much as I am. As soon as I put one in, within five minutes, they are sound asleep! My husband keeps joking and asking if there if some kind of drug in it! It seems more comfortable to them than my arms alone! They go from sobbing to being perfectly content in a matter of seconds, and from there to la la land in a few minutes! Right now I am holding of the babies all wrapped up and I'm loving it. It's so comfortable and my back doesn't hurt and all. I just did a few loads of laundry and tidied my room and I am as calm and relaxed as this little guy in the wrap. And while I was a believer in this from the first time I saw it's greatness, it took about 3 times to get the wrap done perfectly, but now it's a breeze and I put it on and off many times daily.

"B005SP2LWW","Boba Vs. Ktan","Mak10","August 7, 2015",0,"Format: Baby Product",5,"I originally couldn't decide whether to get the k'tan or the Boba.  I found a used K'tan and it seemed to be the most simple and so I went with that one.  It was awesome in so many ways, but in the end it didn't keep my baby in the correct position (after wearing for a long period) and just stretched out too frequently to be practical for my daily 6+ hours of use.  My favorite thing about the K'tan is that it introduced me to the proper type of carrier for a newborn (I tried the Ergo with my son and it was horrible for that age) and that it also mentally prepared me for the next step - which was a real wrap- something that was scary to me.  So I found a used Boba and have been using it for about a week.  It keeps my baby in the correct position all day and just feels more supportive in general.  It also has resulted in less back pain.  If the K'tan is the lowest introduction to infant babywearing, then the Boba is the next baby step into babywearing.  Here is a comparison:K'tan Pros:- Super Easy, not intimidating at all.  I did not need any practice with this.  Just followed the video and put the baby in.- Smaller - this makes it a lot easier to put in a diaper bag- Shorter - if I know I am going to be putting it on somewhere dirty I would rather use the K'tan because there is no chance it would drag on the ground while putting it on- Faster to put onBoba Pros:- Easy - the first use was less than perfect (but still worked), by the third use it was second nature to wrap.  they have a basic wrap that works with both types of carries so once you learn that you are good to go.- More supportive and not sized - This results in a snug fit that lasts- Can be left on when baby is not on you - so if you are running errands and you don't want to keep putting it on and off, just tie it on before you leave and transfer baby in and out.  Super quick and easy.  And if you get a pretty color it can look okay with no baby as well :)In the end I like having both.  They both allow me to carry my baby and still tend to my toddler.  My K'tan is now my backup and it works great for that.  I think it could also work for someone who does not babywear almost all day.  Fortunately I was able to buy both of these used for less than buying just one of them new.  If I could only have one - it would be the Boba.  And to my earlier self who was scared of learning to use it I would say that its super easy and not scary at all!!",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFFI3TB226GGCIJ44CV4PSTSOPWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFFI3TB226GGCIJ44CV4PSTSOPWA"

Not to mention, it's HOT! You will be reluctant to use this if you live in a hot place even if you can get it to work correctly. And unless you're wearing a unitard, this thing is going to bunch up your clothes and create a constant need to tug at the bottom of your shirt to pull it back down while simultaneously holding your baby with the other arm so the baby doesn't slide further down. Unfortunately, I can't return this to Target either, because I ruined the box opening it and threw it away before I realized how bad this thing is. $40.00 down the drain.

There are only two ways in the instructions to wrap them up in it and it seems like a baby can't face front.

"B005SP2LWW","I wanted to love this, because my Baby Bjorn carrier kills my ...","Natalie Harper","June 19, 2015",1,"Format: Baby Product",3,"I wanted to love this, because my Baby Bjorn carrier kills my back, and I needed a solution. I felt sure this would be it because of the rave reviews. It's not exactly what I was hoping for, but it definitely has some pros. Here are the basic details of my situation and the pros and cons for me.Situation: My baby boy is 9lbs, 8 oz currently, but I started using this when he weighed around 7lbs. He suffers from severe acid reflux, which constantly wakes him up and prevents him from sleeping for more than 1 hour at a time. He's a preemie (born at 31 weeks) and is now ~2.5 months old; ~3 weeks adjusted. I am 5'6 and am not overweight but not petite either. Overall, I am in good shape but not a fitness queen as of late.Pros: My boy will sleep for hours in this, so that is a major pro. He won't sleep this well anywhere else except in his car seat in the car while it is moving. It doesn't hurt my back right away like the baby bjorn carrier. It's less expensive than a lot of other options. There are several colors to choose from.Cons:- I HATE putting this on. There is so much excess fabric that it's hard to handle. If your baby is crying while you are trying to put this on, you feel every darn second, and it's easy to get flustered.- The excess fabric is a bit annoying once you have on. Yes, you just wrap it around as many times as you need, but I find it uncomfortable. My husband is 6'4 and is great shape, and it has excess fabric for him as well.- I saw lots of reviews that mentioned tying it very tightly and keeping the fabric neat/not bunched. I find it quite difficult to do this when putting it on. I watched the YouTube video and followed instructions, and at this point, I have still found it impossible to get it tight enough to prevent my baby from eventually drooping down very low. I start with his head against my chest and him sitting upright, and without fail, he always ends up in a slouched sling position below my breasts. In addition, I can never get the fabric to stay as neat and orderly as it appears in all the pictures/videos. Because of all this, it does start to hurt my back, and the position can be uncomfortable for me. I wish it would hold him up against my chest because that is so much more comfortable for me and allows me to get more done. Perhaps I will get better at this, but I have tried many times (with a lot of effort and hope, haha) and still have yet to accomplish it. It's simply frustrating to mess with, and I sometimes dread putting it on.Overall, I just wish there was less fabric (or size options) and that it was a little less stretchy and more sturdy. On the positive side, he'll sleep once I finally get it on and get him in it.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHPBXZTVITEEUJG7WKDBHUA2D7CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHPBXZTVITEEUJG7WKDBHUA2D7CQ"

"B005SP2LWW","My baby doesn't like it.","Mom@Home","June 16, 2015",1,"Format: Baby Product",2,"I decided to try the Boba wrap when my second baby was born.  She is now four months old.  While I find the Boba wrap to be about as easy to put on as the original Baby Bjorn I used with my first baby, I am giving the Boba wrap two stars because I just can't use it.  My baby just doesn't like it.  She gets tense, struggles, and cries every time I put her in it.  I have tried several different types of ""holds"" including the newborn hold (in the instructions that come with it), piggyback hold, and side hold.  A couple times when she was a newborn, it helped her fall asleep if she was having a crying fit, at home, but I can't use it out and about without her really going into a full-on cry.  I really wanted to like this thing because it IS a lot more comfortable, with less back strain, for the adult.  But it seems like my baby (who by the way LOVED being swaddled) just doesn't seem to like being completely bandaged to me as I walk around.  I think it's a little too restricting for a baby who is awake and alert, which is funny because on the Boba website they have some ""articles"" about how other baby-carrying devices are too restricting and impede babies' development.By the way, I used my classic-style Baby Bjorn just about every day with my first baby.  We walked all the time.  I used my common sense and took her out if it seemed like she'd been in there long enough.  She never had any problems.....  in fact I think she really liked it.Our family has a big trip to Europe coming up this summer, so now I'm trying to find a helpful baby carrier before we go.  My trusty old Bjorn is okay for neighborhood walks, but it isn't great for a sleeping baby.  My top choice is the Aprica 4-way style carrier (that lets baby lie horizontally if they fall asleep).I still hope to be able to use the Boba wrap.  Maybe my daughter will like it more when she gets older... at the same time, I don't really feel like it's right to keep seeing if she likes it when I already know she doesn't. <_<",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHLWZ7YPNDPRRSWPJCTJ2GYWFEQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHLWZ7YPNDPRRSWPJCTJ2GYWFEQQ"

"B005SP2LWW","Amazing wrap!!","Carolyn S","June 6, 2015",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"I love this product! My baby is almost 2 months old and she loves it too! Some days it is literally the ONLY way she will fall asleep is if I have her in this. The biggest thing I think people will complain about is the baby sagging down in the wrap. This will happen eventually depending on how long you wear your baby. HOWEVER, to avoid the sagging until much later, you MUST have the wrap incredibly tight!! The best piece of advice I have gotten on this wrap is tie it tighter than you think you need it. Almost to where it is uncomfortable. Once baby is in there, they will loosen it up a little bit and it will be just right. The how-to wrap videos on boba's website aren't that great compared to the ones on youtube. There is one called how to's and reviews on the boba wrap (blonde girl doing the video) and I found that one to be the best one. I also found it a lot of help to practice wrapping at home and wearing baby at home before I tried to use it outside of the home. Once I was comfortable wrapping and placing her in there, I felt SO MUCH BETTER using it at the grocery store. I also think that some babies just might not like this because they don't like being so wrapped up and tight. My son, for instance, did not like to be swaddled at all. But my daughter loves it and she loves this wrap. I don't think my son would have liked it too much. So it all depends on the baby. But it is definitely worth a shot if you have more than one kid because it definitely helps you get things done around the house!! I have not yet mastered the art of nursing while baby is in the wrap but it can be done so that is also a plus to using this product! Overall I am very pleased with this thing!!",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGHGSTBJ65DMT3RQQ7B4ADOKCYOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGHGSTBJ65DMT3RQQ7B4ADOKCYOQ"
"B005SP2LWW","Too hot for Texas","Brian Bankhead","June 6, 2015",1,"Format: Baby Product",3,"At first it was a little daunting, figuring out how to wrap this 6 yards of fabric around you in a way to securely hold our newborn. After watching a few youtube videos my wife felt confident enough to try it out. When she can wear it she really loves it, but I had to give it just three stars because much to our dismay we're going to have to buy a hotslings as well because the boba wrap gets so hot that we can use it beyond 45 minutes. Granted we live in Texas and it's June but our newborn gets too hot from my wife just walking around the house at 6:30am. This is really a shame because the wrap is great at calming our LO, it's just disappointing that we're having to buy a second carrier so that she doesn't overheat. After about 30-45 minutes she will start to cry only calming down after my wife has pulled aside at least two layers of the Boba Wrap. When it comes down to it ourLO is wearing 4 layers of clothing (short sleeve onesie + 3 layers of the wrap) and snug against mom.I would not recommend for a summer baby in Texas but that could be a different story for cooler months.

It arrived today and it is exactly what I hoped for. Wrapping, even the first time, is not hard at all (easier than the Ergo baby, I would say!).

Wearing the baby is so much easier than trying to take her in the car seat (which takes up the entire shopping cart). She typically falls asleep while I wear her in the Boba, but even if she doesn't, she is very content in it. It also helps to keep strangers from feeling like they can touch her. If she gets fussy while I am trying to do things around the house, I just put on my wrap and wear her around the house.It took a couple of attempts to get it on just right, but now it is really quick and easy to put it on and put her in it.

Initially, it is a pain to figure it out and a few times, you will have to undo it and try again because it will be too loose and Baby will hang too low.  In general I do not enjoy putting it on and even taking it off is a drag.  It is also HOT so this is not a summer item unless you're always in air conditioning.  Those are the cons.However, once I do have it on properly, I love it.  My son enjoys it too and I have my hands free to do other things. I definitely prefer it to those carriers that look like backpacks - just my personal preference but those carriers seem so impersonal.  My son feels secure and happy in the boba. I feel pregnant again (in a good way) because we're so close.  He tends to instantly fall asleep almost because he's so comfortable.  And one of the things I like the most is that I don't feel pressure on my back or shoulders.  The material holds the baby's weight.  That's really helpful when you're working with a postpartum body that isn't as strong as it once was.  So I think it's gentle on me.  My son is almost 20lbs, super long and barely 5 months.  Oh and even though it's hot, if you're out on a breezy day or if you're in a cold supermarket, it's a hassle free alternative to a blanket.  I get so tired of trying to properly cover my child with a blanket when it's falling about the place and... well you know what I mean if you've ever had to grapple with a blanket and a squirming baby.

I found the Boba to be very very warm, and sags with a 13 pound baby, and again.. really really hot.. like heat stroke hot. Woven wraps come in cotton blend, cotton/bamboo blend, and linen blend, which are much cooler, also there is no stretch in the fabric, thus no sagging.

For me, the amount of fabric is overwhelming (it drags along the floor as you are tying it), and it is cumbersome to tie it in the specific manner needed.  Once you have the fabric tied to you correctly, it difficult to place the baby inside.  The baby also didn't seem to like being carried it it very much, I think it isn't a comfortable fit - I think the baby is too squished (my baby is currently 1 month old, I tried it when we first brought him home from the hospital, and again just a few days ago).

"B005SP2LWW","Just what I expected based on other reviews","Esperanza","March 18, 2015",1,"Format: Baby Product",4,"I read about a gazillion reviews for different types of wraps before finally settling on a Boba Baby Wrap.  Reading about the various types of wraps was mind-boggling, and I didn't know which one to choose; so finally I decided to let my color preference settle the matter.  I chose the Boba Wrap so I could get PURPLE.  And it is a very nice, grape-y shade of purple, similar to the color of my favorite sweatshirt jacket in college days.This was a purchase for use with my fifth child.  I hadn't even heard of this kind of baby carrier before, with my previous pregnancies.  I watched several video demonstrations on how to put it on and get the baby into it, so by the time it arrived in the mail, I knew just what to do.  What all the other reviewers have to say is true---put it on pretty tight.  The material is like a super-soft, stretchy T-shirt or like a very lightweight and cozy sweatshirt.  Lots of give.  And it is warm, which was great for me with my Christmas baby.  But now that the weather is warming up here in Florida, it's not the greatest for use outdoors.For use around the house---like when baby wants to be held and I want to be able to type on my computer or sort laundry---it's perfect.  But if I want to be able to wear it out and about, I have to put it on in the house before I leave (same as so many other reviewers).  It IS a ton of fabric, and I don't think there would be any way to put it on without it dragging on the floor/ground at least a little bit.  And if you need to nurse or pump milk, unless you're wearing special clothing for nursing, you'll probably need to take the thing off (or loosen it so much that the only way to get the baby back in would be to completely re-tie it).This wrap IS super-cozy for the baby, though.  If he is tired and I put him in, he's asleep in no time flat.  If he's awake and wants to look around and be able to move a bit, though, then it just kind of makes him mad.  That's partly because he still has weak head/neck control.  Babies who can hold their heads up and look around probably like it much better.The bottom line for me on this type of wrap (and why I gave it four stars instead of five) is that it's just not as convenient to use as certain other types of carriers.  I brought both the Boba and a linen ring sling along on a recent family vacation.  I used the ring sling constantly but never once reached for the Boba.  It just wouldn't have been as convenient.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHRUODYXODFWBHDA5YMSVOEWU5HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHRUODYXODFWBHDA5YMSVOEWU5HA"

"B005SP2LWW","Skip this wrap","Rachel G.","March 3, 2015",1,"Format: Baby Product",1,"My baby is six weeks and we've been using it from about week one. I have mixed feelings about this wrap. I'll start with the positive. Once the wrap is on and baby's in it, the wrap is okay. But to get to that point is a nightmare...This wrap is not for busty women. In order for baby to be secure, the wrap has to be snug. So if it's snug around your waist and rib cage then it super snug around your bust. This makes baby squished at your chest. There is no way to adjust the level of snugness around the different body parts. If I loosen the wrap at the chest and keep it tight at the waist then baby just slides down off chest and ends up under the breasts.As many women have posted...the wrap is several yards long. If you care about germs, you don't want to put this on in public, it will be all over the floor.Next, it is tricky to get baby in and out of. The fabric is tight against the chest so it's tough to ""slide"" baby into, out of the wrap. It's also very hot to wear this wrap, then add baby and it's even hotter. I have used it in MT and in southern CA where it's currently 70 degrees. Much too hot in Cali but was ok in February in Montana.Also , this wrap is made in China by a company based in Colorado. Easily this product could be made in the US.I would never have bought this wrap had I known how not user friendly it is. Perhaps when my baby is bigger it will work better. I have the Ergo 360 but not the infant insert and I'm looking forward to using it once my baby is larger.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF4N2CJZCEUOINMSRL4DHKA4TG2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF4N2CJZCEUOINMSRL4DHKA4TG2A"

He likes to be close to me pretty much all day so I knew I would need a wrap or carrier. Because he was so small I needed a wrap that would allow me to position him in a way that would simulate the womb and this wrap has been perfect for that. We use it while around the house and while out shopping. I can allow him to poke his head out and look around or completely cover him (while in crowds) to protect him from people's big germs. He usually falls right asleep when placed inside.Getting the wrap on is easy and fast. I watched a few you tube videos before the wrap even came so when it was delivered to me I knew exactly what to do. I love the stretchy fabric!The one drawback that I have noticed is that we both tend to get hot.

My daughter refuses to nap, so I bought this in hopes that she'd be lulled to sleep by the motions of me trying to get things done around the house. It works. We've been using it successfully since she was around 3 weeks!It's even more amazing when you go out. Everyone constantly comments on how well-behaved and quiet she is while I'm wearing her. I can go grocery shopping without worrying over a fussy baby! She either quietly watches the world around her or nods off for a nice little nap.The comfort level is good, though you may find some strain on your neck despite the ""proper placement."" This is especially noticeable once baby gets a little bigger and has their feet hanging out. It's still comfortable, however! And it's fantastic sitting, as it doesn't bunch up or pinch the baby's legs like 'harder' carriers seem to (I have a Boba 4G and baby does not like it when I sit in it!)There's also some preparation involved if you're using it outside of the house. It's best to put it on before you leave and just wear it while driving and then put baby in it when you arrive.

I bought the orange colored wrap and it is definitely orange. On my monitor it looked more coral, but it isn't. Just be aware it is ORANGE. Also, I thought about making this myself since it is just a strip of fabric, but the cotton/spandex knit fabric at the store was around ten bucks per yard, so this really isn't a bad deal considering that you're getting 16 feet of this fabric :).",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFFL2CJEULAQFRRZGOVKB4CY6PMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFFL2CJEULAQFRRZGOVKB4CY6PMQ"

It is pretty easy to use and after a couple times you can get it on pretty quickly and easily. Used it from our first week home with my baby who was probably about 6.5 lbs at that time.  My baby wanted to be held all the time, so I often would put her in the wrap in order to get laundry or anything done around the house during my maternity leave.  Also used it going to Target, the mall, and other outings and it worked great.  She loved being in the wrap and snuggled close to me and would sleep very well in it.

I have a shorter 100% cotton wrap and it's a bit cooler. It may be the length of the wrap that causes the internal heat wave due to the multiple times one has to double wrap and wrap. The fabric is a nice, sturdy cotton and wouldn't rip or tear easily.The length makes it near impossible to wrap baby anywhere, but home. You could charge admission for the show you put on for the many onlookers in the grocery parking lot. I have wrapped at home prior to going out, but it's difficult to put baby in and take out comfortably. It's much more convenient and comfortable for both of us to wrap baby to me. That's where the awkwardness of the length gets in the way. I have gone in the nursing rooms or dressing rooms to wrap, but I think that defeats the purpose.The stretchy fabric is also bit strange. You want to wrap baby so tight to keep them snug, but it ends up stretching out anyways...

"B005SP2LWW","Love it!","Leigh","November 12, 2014",1,"Format: Baby Product",4,"I spent months agonizing over what type of wrap to get (I had never used one before) and couldn't decide between this Boba (which is a stretchy wrap) or a Moby, or a woven wrap.  I went with the Boba because I had read that it was especially good for the newborn phase and I was planning to get an Ergo for when my baby was older.I love the wrap, and I'm really glad I went for the stretchy material.  My daughter wanted only to be held in the first several months and using the Boba wrap I could easily carry her around everywhere (and make dinner, and go shopping, and help my toddler).  I looked up videos on how to tie it and used it from the moment my daughter was 2 weeks old.  It's comfortable and easy to use and I even got handy with putting it on while seated in the car.  I travelled with my daughter in an airplane when she was 3 months old and kept this wrap on the entire flight (8 hours) and used it to help support her while breast feeding (did this often elsewhere as well) and she slept for hours while snuggled up in it against me.Some disadvantages are that as she got bigger, I still usually used a hand to support her as she would slide down in the wrap (if I didn't have it pulled tight enough), and we didn't use this in the summer months because it was just WAY TOO HOT and my baby would sweat within minutes of being put in this.  Also, I have the black colour and parts of it became discoloured within a few months of use.  But these are minor annoyances (except the heat!).  So for cooler months/climate, I would absolutely recommend this.

"B005SP2LWW","Best Stretch Wrap I've Used","Rachel B. Ramey (blogger/author)","November 8, 2014",0,"Format: Baby Product",5,"Most baby carriers have a learning curve -- some styles more than others.  And we all have our preferences.  For me, a stretch wrap is not my first-pick, go-to all-purpose carrier.  However, a ""snuggly"" carrier like this is excellent for tiny babies.  And this is, hands-down, the best one I've used.I had tried stretch wraps in the past, and I *hated* them.  They were bulky and heavy and seemingly a mile long.  I felt like I was drowning before I ever even got them wrapped, or put a baby in them.  Then I tried the Boba Wrap and it was like night and day.  Yes, it still requires tying -- that's the nature of a wrap.  Yes, it's still fairly long -- that, too, is just the nature of a wrap.  But this is SOOO much lighter.  And there's not a lot of excess length.  I'm a tiny woman -- just over five feet tall and under 100 lbs. -- and I don't have a ton of fabric left over after tying this.(Do be aware, though, that if you're tying it right, there should NOT be slack before putting the baby in.  It's designed to be stretchy enough that it STRETCHES to make room for the baby.)If you want something you don't have to wrap and tie, a wrap might not be for you, at least as a general-purpose carrier.  (My personal favorites are the Boba 4G and the Maya Wrap, for general ""around town""-type use.)  But if you're looking for a stretchy wrap, I think this is the best.I received this carrier free for review purposes.  However, all opinions are 100% my own.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGT2Q6G7UG4TBJFL7FQTWM5LKWQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGT2Q6G7UG4TBJFL7FQTWM5LKWQA"

I wasn't sure I'd be able to trust that the wrap was tight enough. I was worried that my baby would fall out! The first time I tried the Boba wrap, I realized that I had nothing to worry about. Just follow the directions (included in the package and also posted on Amazon and on the Boba website) and you'll be ok. Remember that young babies shouldn't have their legs hanging straight down--their hips need to be in frog-leg style. The instructions help you figure it out. Also, make sure your baby can breathe.My baby is 2 1/2 months now and I've been using the wrap since she was about 3 weeks old. She didn't like being in the wrap for very long in the beginning, though she'd tolerate it on some days for up to half an hour. I also tried to use the wrap when she was cluster feeding, but I never really got the hang of it and it was easier to just cuddle with her.Now, though, my baby is often happy to be wrapped close to me for longer amounts of time. She's able to hold her head up better, so for the most part my hands really are ""free"" when she's in her wrap (before, I had to support her head most of the time because she wouldn't keep her head inside the wrap). It's really great to be able to hold my baby near me without actually holding her. My arms and shoulders feel so much better at the end of the day.To summarize: I love this wrap and I haven't once worried about dropping or suffocating my baby.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF6J5S76N3E52XNARY66M2ITNNZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF6J5S76N3E52XNARY66M2ITNNZA"

After much practice putting the wrap on, I finally felt confident enough to put the baby in the wrap and try it out. Even though I had it on properly, I felt as though the baby might fall out. I never felt comfortable enough to bend over with the baby in the wrap without holding onto the baby to make sure she didn't come out. I found the wrap its self to be very stretchy, and no matter how tightly  I would wrap it around me it would stretch out and make me feel insecure about putting the baby in it. Therefore, I've used it maybe 3 times and it just sits in its box in the closet. Very disappointed. I thought this would be a more convenient product then it is, and easier to put on without the feeling of ""OH GOD IS THE BABY GOING TO FALL OUT?!?!""",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFI6NXMJ6LVSKWYDRV2WN3YJ3PLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFI6NXMJ6LVSKWYDRV2WN3YJ3PLA"

I love the Moby wrap, too, but here are some key differences:Moby: thicker fabric, no sagging baby after hours of wear; pre-wrapping is much harder and much higher learning curve necessary to pre-wrap than the Boba. If you pre-tie it too tightly, then you have to start all over again.Boba: less thick fabric that is stretchier, tends to sag after a few hours of wear, but easily adjustable; more forgiving when it comes to pre-wrapping because of the stretch. If you tie too tightly, stretches out. in fact, you want to tie it a little tigher than you think you need to so that you have room for it to sag a little once you've been carrying baby around for a while.

"B005SP2LWW","The Boba wrap is a must for any parent.","K &amp; M Williams","September 25, 2014",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"When you receive the warp it comes in its own little tote bag made out of the same fabric of the wrap. The tote bag makes the wrap so compact and portable so when it‚Äôs not in use you simply roll the wrap back up and tuck it back in.  The wrap itself is very soft and stretchy it is made out of 95% cotton 5% Spandex, which is something I love because whenever it gets dirty I simply toss it in the washing machine and either let it air dry or if I‚Äôm in desperate need of using it again I toss it in the dryer. I prefer to let it air dry because my wrap is grey and I feel like it fades with so many washes.When you put the wrap on you do need to have both handles available, the wrap is a really long piece of fabric, the dimensions are 6x6x11.5 inches. Essentially you wrap the fabric around your upper body to create a little pocket for you baby to be in, It takes a few seconds to put the wrap on. I do suggest watching the videos on the Boba website, they are very helpful. I love my wrap and I am very passionate about recommending it to everyone I know. The wrap doesn‚Äôt make me feel sweaty when I am baby wearing and its made of a light fabric so I never feel like my child will be too hot.I have gone in the pool with my wrap on and the chlorine didn‚Äôt affect the color, I have hiked for hours with my wrap on and it has held up perfectly and offered me and my child great support. I take my wrap to Disneyland and discreetly nurse in public while wearing my wrap. My favorite thing about the wrap is that it has no hooks, cords or straps that rub up against my face or worse my sleeping baby‚Äôs face. In summary, the wrap is portable, compact, easily stored and perfect for bonding with your little one while still having free hands, which is great in my book because I have 3 other children that require my attention :) .

There are a lot of high quality carriers out there, for being under 50 dollars, it does the job. But the amount if inconviennce it is to wrap a 20 foot price of cloth around your body keeps me from wanting to use it in public, like shopping, walking in the mall, a stroll through the park. Wrapping this carrier on your body involves a lot of dragging on the ground. I'm not sure how many moms would be willing to drag it all over the mall floor then put their baby in it-i don't reccomend it. Also, because you tie a large knot in the back, you cannot sit wearing this (like say you are trying to be smart by putting it on at home so when you get to the store you can place your baby in it) unless you find it comfortable to sit with what feels like a foot being pressed into your back.Because this material is stretchy, after using it for a while you have to take it off and re wrap. That may not seem like a big deal but sometimes you don't have a place to put your baby down to do it...since you know, you left your car seat in the car because you bought a baby carrier. It is such a pain in the neck to take off and pit back on, unless you are a professional calf wrangler or have intermidiate lasso skills or something.For at home use, under 45 mins its great. For tiny 5 pound babies its great.

When it arrived, the fabric was indeed very soft, but I found that the material is actually TOO stretchy (which you'd think would be a good thing but in this case is not). Because it is so stretchy, I have to wrap it around me and tie it much, much tighter than I did the big piece of fabric I used originally. Doing this requires more coordination and placing the pieces exactly right; its less user-friendly. Once my baby is placed inside (she's 15 lbs), she sags down much more than she did in the piece of ""harder"" fabric I used before.I'll go back to my free, cheap piece of material, even though its not as cute or as soft as this one.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFRO5QBBM7YUR6MF2BDW24CSPP4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFRO5QBBM7YUR6MF2BDW24CSPP4Q"

I gave it a couple of goes before laughing myself silly (and a bit hysterical, as sleep is a luxury at this juncture) at how amazingly awkward I am with this thing.I refuse to buy yet ANOTHER baby carrier, so I will give it another try.

"B005SP2LWW","it became very clear to me that this was not the best choice. After you get the stroller through security","Kayleen Overlund","July 17, 2014",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"I have 4 children and with the first three, I never gave in to purchasing a ""wrap"". I thought they looked a little hippy dippy to be honest and I still sort of do. That being said, who cares... This makes life so much more simple. I admit that I still will not wear this out in public on the daily. However, we are flying to TN in a week and this is going to save us and the general flying public a lot of time and hassle. Originally the plan was to bring the stroller so we had it while in the airport. After reading thousands of tips and watching quite a few youtube videos about flying with babies, it became very clear to me that this was not the best choice. After you get the stroller through security, you then have to take it apart and pack it in the stroller bag so you can check it at the gate. What a pain in the butt! My layover is only an hour and a half. I do not want to be breaking down and putting together a travel system stroller for such a small amount of time. The only reason I was entertaining the idea of checking the stroller at the gate, was so that I had a place to set my baby down so I could have both hands free when I needed them. This product solves that problem. I can wear this through the airport and have both hands free to do what I need to do! I can walk right through security wearing my baby in this wrap and never have to be separated from her. My hands are free to roll a suitcase and hand over my passes and just do whatever it is I need to do without holding up the line. I ordered the grey so that my husband can also wear it if he should ever need to... The point is, this was a simple solution to a big problem. Worth every dime. I also plan to wear it on the plan with my daughter in it on my lap. My hope is that she will feel restrained enough to feel as though she is in a car seat and not want to move and wiggle around during the flight.

He's a little over 2lbs now and probably about 11 weeks but we aren't exactly sure since I found him starving to death, dumped in the woods when he was barely big enough to walk. Since he was so tiny, so fragile and so scared when I first found him I pretty much held him nearly 24/7 for the first two weeks. He's a strong, healthy, happy little man now and even though I feel comfortable letting him run around the house he's very attached to me and often loudly and relentlessly demands to be held and carried. This poses an issue when I have housework to do or even when I sit down at my computer to complete school work. I felt bad having to reject his pleas for affection so I looked for a kitten friendly version of a baby sling but couldn't find anything. I decided to take a chance and just order one made for infants. I purchased the smallest Boba wrap and the problem was instantly solved. It's easy to put on, and comfortable for both of us, and now I can let him sleep on me or just ride around and purr while I have both hands free. It also keeps him from plopping himself down on my keyboard when I'm trying to type, so that's certainly an added bonus.

I will say that the key is properly tying it (HINT: IT NEEDS TO BE VERY TIGHT with the middle part starting to ride up as you pull it tight). It isn't hard to tie once you get it, but it is subject to human error.  Nevertheless I love that anyone, in any size, can use this. It is easy to clean, and is also relatively stylish.

"B005SP2LWW","Perfect for snuggling with baby","Kiran","May 27, 2014",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"I initially purchased the Balboa baby sling from BuyBuyBaby (my other favorite baby gear store) but returned it within one week because I hated it because my baby hated it! The sling was difficult to get right for my then 6 week old who was too young to put in that contraption - no matter how tight I made the sling (which for those of you who have tried it, once you make it that tight to fit a tiny tiny person, it is extremely difficult to get off - especially when your baby is wailing!) I tried that thing a few times during that week but I never felt comfortable that no matter what I was doing, my baby was breathing properly and that it was safe. So I returned it.I initially did NOT want a long wrap with lots and lots of fabric that I had to figure out what to do with.  Not to mention that I was uncomfortable with the thought that the fabric might unravel and that I might drop my baby!  But after failing at one of those pre-made slings, I had to try something that I could make on my own and women had been using for centuries to carry their little ones.So I did a little bit of research on wraps and slings and narrowed it down to this or the Moby wrap from Amazon. I don't remember what I saw that made me select the Boba over the Moby (price maybe) but I went with this.  So far this product is amazing! This is my favorite item next to my baby's car seat, here's why:1. I can hold my baby super close to my heart and chest giving both me and my baby lots of comfort. I didn't realize how much I missed having that close connection with my baby during my pregnancy until I wore him in this for a couple of weeks and remembered that this little guy that i was hugging on the outside of my body was just inside my body a few short weeks ago.2. The color in grey is nice and subtle and sometimes when I wear this wrap, it looks like its a cool part of my outfit (not really but at least I don't feel like i'm wearing a backpack).3. I can wear the sling all day long.  When I put baby in his car seat, I hop into the driver's seat and take off without unclipping/unwrapping/undoing anything. When I get to where I need to be, I just pop baby back in and we head off. I didn't realize how much mobility this offers me compared to a stroller but if you don't have one of these - you seriously need one.4. BEST thing to get baby to go to sleep.  You can wear this 3 ways from what I've seen so far (infant hug hold, cradle hold, and baby hug hold -where the baby's legs are dangling from the bottom). I use this in the cradle hold to get my baby to sleep and tuck him in the fabric to hold his head secure and his body snug to mine. With a few bouncy bouncy bouncies on a quick 2 minute walk, my baby is out for his nap!I love the concept of this baby carrier, which is why i gave it 5 stars. However, I am on the lookout for a cooler version of the wrap for the summer time as the material doesn't breathe very much and after an hour walking with my son, he gets too hot and sweaty (for those of you who are trying to figure that out, when you are hot and sweaty, so is your baby because heat transfers when you are holding your baby).If you currently do not have a baby carrier and have a newborn or infant less than 12 weeks - I HIGHLY recommend the wrap. it is perfect for you and your baby and is probably easier to get him accustomed to being in this early on rather than later on.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHA62PZJRAYA6ORSF6X7SO2TEXJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHA62PZJRAYA6ORSF6X7SO2TEXJA"

I was busy so I put it away and didn't think much of it.Fast forward a little over a year and I'm expecting my second and trying to figure out what carriers I will have.

The baby, himself, emits a ton of heat and then there are all these layers of fabric on top of him.  I think when he was a newborn, this was particularly useful because it provided a lot of close bodily contact. Also, he was tinier than other babies and didn't have much head control making a lot of other carriers hard to use. You get the hang of wrapping it pretty quickly but it's long and unwieldy so there is no good way to do it in public without all the fabric dragging on the ground. Because of that, I tend to only use it indoors when I want to keep the baby with me while I'm reading, watching TV, etc. A piece of advice is to wrap it tightly, a lot more tightly than you initially think is necessary.  The fabric is incredibly stretchy. Once you add the weight of the baby, it really sags, so it needs to be snug before you put him in.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF3ERH3TU72TZ3MY334WSSPPPZEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF3ERH3TU72TZ3MY334WSSPPPZEQ"

My baby would only sleep when she was being held, but as soon as you put her down, she would wake up a few minutes later and start fussing and eventually crying. I needed something that I could put her in that would allow me to at least do things, like the dishes, cleaning, vacuuming, etc. I tried several times to get her in it, but she was not liking it! A couple times, I waited until she was deep asleep, then tried to put her in.

"B005SP2LWW","Pretty Nice","Kyle D Kinder","April 16, 2014",1,"Format: Baby Product",4,"Had the Boba wrap for a couple of days now - first and only wrap or sling I've tried. Firstly, there is ALOT of fabric to this wrap when you're wrangling it around yourself, but it works just fine if you watch the YouTube vid on how to wrap it. Don't be intimidated by the fabric. Also have to make sure you wrap this pretty tight around yourself to start with, or your baby will ride too low. Our kiddo is 6.5 weeks, 12 lbs, 24"" long - a big boy. He fits very well in this wrap, and I find it's fairly comfortable to wear. It has really freed up my hands - he's sitting in the Boba right now while I'm typing, which is great! I have noticed, however, that the baby gets a bit warm in this wrap - it is about 2-3 layers that cover him. I've taken to putting him in the wrap with just a diaper on or just a very light t-shirt halfsie. My reason for the 4 star is mainly because the baby runs warm in it, and that limits using this wrap outside in warmer weather.  I also wish this wrap could be used in a face-forward position for the baby so that he could look around more.  But I really do enjoy having him pressed right against me as I sit and work at my desk, buzz around the kitchen and house, etc.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF35DUATVP3FOQJFMPPMJA3PQMFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF35DUATVP3FOQJFMPPMJA3PQMFA"

"B005SP2LWW","Comparison: Boba Wrap, Baby K'Tan, Lillebaby, and Ergo Baby.","PepiBumbo","March 17, 2014",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"I used four different carriers for my baby: a Baby K'Tan, this Boba Wrap, an Ergo Baby, and a Lillebaby. Here are the pros and cons of each:First, the Baby K'Tan. I tried this one first and loved it for my newborn. The main advantage to the K'Tan is that it is sort of a Boba or Moby Wrap for Dummies: easier to put on, and made of less stretchy fabric. This held my baby snugly to my chest, and this was the ONLY way she would nap most afternoons. I spent a lot of time with her in this! The fabric does stretch out eventually, but I simply put the K'tan in the washer and through the dryer on high heat, and it went back to its original size. Cons: The K'Tan is sized, so unless you want to buy two (or you are the same size), your partner wont' be able to use it. As my baby got heavier, we needed a carrier my husband could use, too. Also ,the support strap ties in back, and this is uncomfortable if you want to wear the carrier while sitting (for example, on a long airplane flight).Second, the Boba Wrap. This was the second carrier I bought. I love the soft, stretchy, thick fabric--much better feeling than a Moby. Also, the wrap ties in front so there is no knot in the back when you are sitting. Unlike the K'Tan, this one requires you to figure out how to wrap and tie, and it is a bit of a learning curve. However, the plus side was that my husband could use this, too. Now that my baby is over 6 months old, though, we mostly use the Lillebaby as it is more supportive and distributes her weight better.Third, the Ergo Baby. We ended up returning this one. For one, the infant insert just did not work out for us. Every time my husband tried this, the baby would start crying and fussing. For a newborn, it is definitely better to use a stretchy wrap like the Boba or K'Tan.Finally, the Lillebaby. This is the carrier we are currently using for our 7 month old. It supports her weight well, allows for multiple positions (including outward facing, which she now prefers), and does not require her to dangle from her crotch (as a Bjorn does). But this would not have been as comfy for her as a newborn.Overall, if you plan to get two carriers, I'd recommend the Boba (for an infant) and the Lillebaby for a larger baby.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEPPVSCH6SI4QUMH3USAY27HU6RQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEPPVSCH6SI4QUMH3USAY27HU6RQ"

I checked out a couple of videos on you tube for it, so it only takes 15 seconds to wrap it around, then slide the little one in.  I've used it while shopping.  I've used it while eating out.  Otherwise I would leave him in his car seat and carry that thing around, but he hates sitting in his car seat too long (key fit 30). When he is cranky and needs to get to sleep I use it (creating a habit I'm sure, but hey, he is 5 weeks) I slide him in and he's asleep within 10 minutes. I've also become an expert in sliding him out of it to lay him in his crib while sleeping.  The fabric is stretchy and soft.

So at first you need to spend the time learning how to put this on and practice. It's really not that hard and with some practice you and baby are on your way! My munchkin loves this... I put her in and she falls asleep almost instantly. She is comfortable and happy to be so close to mama. I get things done around the House and take walks with her bundled in. Quality is great and really makes baby feel secure. I read a few ppl saying the baby kept slipping down that's bc it wasn't tight enough, instructions say to make sure it's snug on certain parts while ur wrapping it around urself, just takes practice. It's washable too. Only thing negative I can say is it can get kind of warm since baby is pressed up on you and ur wrapped in cloth, but not that serious.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFPXTKFJAPNRERJG2IJB3NDYOA4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFPXTKFJAPNRERJG2IJB3NDYOA4Q"

"B005SP2LWW","Carrier ""Mommy Style""","Eloquentia","March 5, 2014",1,"",5,"I got this wrap mostly because I was tired of sitting there with my fussy baby and not getting anything done at home. My daughter was 1 week old when we took her for a short walk around the block (she's a New England winter baby, and it's sooo cold here). I put her in a carrier we got from friends, but it just didn't do the trick. I constantly felt that my newborn was too far away from my own body and more or less bouncing around. So I ordered the Boba.It's really simple to put on (I actually watched the youtube videos and found them much easier to understand than the printed explanations) and whenever I put DD in it, she loves being so snug. We now mostly use it for shopping trips (hands-free is a wonderful thing as every new mom can imagine) and not so much for the household. That's just because I cannot figure out how to put her head in there without suffocating her. She hates turning it to one side.So when I bend over a lot (while doing laundry for example), I always need to put one hand behind her head. That's a bit annoying, but pretty surely my own fault.Being in a grocery store, I am mostly in an upright position and she instantly falls asleep in it.It's also nice, that you can always check on the baby and kiss and cuddle him.The fabric is very comfy and of high quality. Very stretchy, but not too much (I was worried about that before). It holds her in place without strangling me and you can't really feel the weight of the child.I prefer the Boba over the Moby Wrap, because I don't have to deal with 'pockets' and I like the fabric on the Boba more.I would definitely recommend this wrap to anyone who wants to keep their child close. Because of its softness it's more for moms I think, my hubby prefers the carrier. It's ""more masculine"".. whatever that means.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEWHXLWAORX6RONLPDKDHDYDTIAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEWHXLWAORX6RONLPDKDHDYDTIAQ"

And it works as it should, and even for my tiny newborn twins it worked very well.  They were able to fit in all curled up in little frog positions, which is what they preferred at that point anyway.  Now they are 3 months old and approaching 15lbs each, so they can sit with legs out and wrapped around me.That being said, we never use this wrap anymore.  It just takes too long to get on and off.  I breastfeed twins, and while sometimes I can get a kid to boob while in this thing, often I can't because they just aren't positioned right or they just don't want to eat in that position.  So I have try to get the darn thing off (or it's the OTHER twin who wants to eat, which is more typical).  With 2 babies crying it also just takes too long to get on.So my husband and nanny use the baby bjorn, and I use a Maya sling or a Seven sling.  When our babies were newborn (6lbs and 7.5lbs) this wrap worked best.  But once they crossed about 8lbs or so the baby bjorn and slings were faster and more convenient.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEPZDFSFXPXSXHZA4IXIXULF4Z2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEPZDFSFXPXSXHZA4IXIXULF4Z2A"

When I had my second, it was quickly apparent that I REALLY needed extra hands, so I revisited the idea of a wrap carrier and stumbled on the Boba.  The Moby Wrap does not have spandex, so it was hard for me to get it on with the right amount of space for the baby.  Not with the Boba!  I wrapped it as tight as I could and stuffed my little newborn in.  Viola!  I had hands free to make dinner, play with my toddler, throw in a load of laundry, and my baby would usually fall asleep with all the bouncing.  At one point I was actually putting her in it for naps because she slept so well!  Now my baby is 10 months old and I still put her in it when my toddler wants to play outside.  I also find it VERY helpful when shopping with my two girls alone.  I put the wrap on before I leave for the store, and then put the baby in when we get there.

I have to start out by saying that I have the organic bjorn baby carrier.  I think that might have to do with why I am not so happy with this one.  I wanted a cloth carrier that was more basic & lightweight.  One good thing is that IF you get it on right, it is practically weightless and comfy.  I have a 20lb 6 month old (BIG BOY!) who loves to be in the bjorn facing out looking around.  The main thing that I don‚Äôt like is that once you get it on you (not all so difficult as some might‚Äôve mentioned), it‚Äôs hard to get your baby in right.  In this wrap, he has to face me so he is always trying to turn around and because of the way he is in the wrap (not so sure if it‚Äôs the way I get him in- he is uncovered from his shoulder up & his arms are out) he is practically leaping out.  Unlike the bjorn, where he is clipped & secured in, I feel that I HAVE to keep one or 2 hands on him at all times to make sure he doesn‚Äôt throw himself out.

I love my ergo but the infant insert (a must for my little one) is too hot for her and me in the Alabama humidity and summer/fall heat. The ring sling is great for quick baby wearing but the rings are very uncomfortable against my collar bone and shoulder. I am a smaller person and the big rings just plain hurt no matter how I pad them with the tail or arrange them on my body. So I needed another option. I bought the Boba for a cooler baby carrier that is simple to use. I like this much better than the ring sling. It's easy to wrap after watching the instructional videos. It's also not as hot as the Ergo. My baby girl loves riding in it. I agree with other reviewers with small frames that there is simply too much fabric. I have to wrap it twice around my waist. I also find it hard to get the proper tautness, but I think that will come with practice and as my baby grows. I would purchase this again.

"B005SP2LWW","Calms baby like nothing else","N","September 11, 2013",0,"",4,"Pros:1. When milk, a clean diaper, being held/bounced/swaddled are not enough, this wrap usually calms my 6 week old baby down and he goes to sleep.  I don't know what I would do otherwise!2. This wrap allows you to get some things done while still holding your baby.  I actually was able to go grocery shopping thanks to this wrap (baby doesn't stay content in the stroller for long).3. I can sit at my computer and type with both hands while holding my baby.  This is SO much better than one handed typing!Cons:1. The wrap takes a minute to put on.  When you have a crying baby that you have to set down (so you can put the wrap on) you feel every second.2. You don't really have both of your hands free unless you're sitting.  When I'm standing I keep a hand on my baby's head to make sure he is supported.  I don't rely on the wrap for this because it's hard to make sure he breathing OK and staying cool with the fabric on his head.3. The wrap can get hot for baby and mom, so it's not the best for the summer.  However it's worth the higher A/C bill to have a calm baby.Comments:-Some reviewers point out that the fabric is really long.  It is, but I just wrap it another time around my waist another time to tie up the long ends.  No problem.-The wrap is easy to put on and comes with clear instructions.  Make it really snug so the baby stays higher up.  This will help prevent your back from getting sore too quickly.-If you tie the wrap on before you drive somewhere you are all set when you arrive (baby doesn't have to wait).-The wrap is even helpful when baby gets cranky in the middle of the night; it helps him to calm down so he can go back to sleep.UPDATE (baby is 5 months old now):I have the Boba Wrap, a sling ring, and a fabric (non-stretchy) wrap.  We still use this one the most because it's the most comfortable over a long period of time.  We go for walks and to restaurants and stores with baby in the Boba wrap.  It's easier than using a stroller because you don't have to avoid bumps in the sidewalk or stairs.Compared to the sling ring wrap: now that my son is old enough to support his torso and head this is a nice alternative because it's faster to put on.  However, it hurts your back faster than the Boba because the weight is all on one side of your back.Compared to the fabric wrap: the Boba is more comfortable because it's stretchy, but it's hotter than the natural fiber tie wrap I have.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFLQPNTWEGYUOGRRWPN2N3WFIQOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFLQPNTWEGYUOGRRWPN2N3WFIQOA"

The wrap keeps her snug and safe against my chest, and she has been much less fussy since I started wearing her during the day.

I flew across the country with her at 6 weeks and she stayed happily in the Boba through the airport, through, security and during the flight, only letting out a small squeak when she was hungry or wet.Before using the Boba, I tried two different slings (I thought they didn't provide enough neck support and she always looked ""scrunched"" in them) as well as our Ergo Baby carrier. The Ergo (with infant insert) is a GREAT carrier, but it's summertime and my baby would get hot inside the insert while outside.Now my baby is two months old and weighs 13 pounds.

"B005SP2LWW","Its Okay","graynbruce","July 30, 2013",1,"",3,"After having my baby, I had a hard time not having my hands free to get more done around the house.  I received a sport carrier from a shower but it was best used when my child could support himself more.  So I decided to purchase a wrap mainly to be more hands free for my infant (0-3 months).  It is not as hands free as its made out to be.  The material is a stretchy/slinky type material.  It can be pulled very tight or kept loose.  If you wrap it too loose your child is not very secure and bounces around a lot with little head support.  The instructions tell you that it should be tight enough to pull the child into you.  If its too tight, its uncomfortable for you and the baby.  When it seems to fit well, I find my child still bounces around a lot and you have to still support him with your hands (like your hugging your baby like in the picture).  If I lean over at all I have to hold on to him and support his back and neck.  It really doesn't allow me to do much more with the wrap than without it.  I tried to do some things around my yard too but we both ended up very sweaty.  The material itself does not seem too hot but when you press a little body next to yours and wrap it tight, it gets hot!  Even inside my child would be sweating after wearing it for a little while.  My expectations were much higher than the outcome. If you are looking at buying this to free yourself up to do all your chores, its not as free as it sounds.  It helps a little (I was able to wash some dishes okay but had trouble with anything that requires bending over or much movement) so I gave it 3 stars.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGXIY22O5KQJLHYGB3Z6VJFCTO7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGXIY22O5KQJLHYGB3Z6VJFCTO7A"

She said that she is also comfortable taking the baby out in public with this carrier. Her husband also used the item and said it was great. They both said it was a little long, but not enough to get in the way. They both like the color. The only complaint is that sometimes the baby would start to get warm after a while, but it is the middle of July.  I would highly recommend visiting the official website for more information.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFP2CXPW657I6PLKLC7XRPJWUFJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFP2CXPW657I6PLKLC7XRPJWUFJQ"

It's easy to take on and off, stretchy, soft, comfortable.My only two complaints are with any wrap like this, not just the Boba - 1) It being July, its a lot of fabric and tends to get hot and 2) you have to have it on in order to put the baby in it, so you have to plan ahead if you are going out and about, and have to literally wear the wrap when you leave the house.  Now that I have mastered my Ring Sling I have been using the Boba a little less frequently.  But I'm sure as it gets cooler I will still use the Boba, and it will still be preferably to the ring sling if I'm gonna be walking for a while, as it is a little more ergonomic and symmetrical (The ring sling hurts my back after a while, the Boba does not cause me pain as long as I get it tight enough!).",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFL6HKITF4MKPX2DR66YN63U42SQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFL6HKITF4MKPX2DR66YN63U42SQ"

However my second son is a baby that wants to be held all the time and nurses super frequently, so a friend of mine basically forced one of these upon me.I tried the Moby and the Boba and I prefer this one for a few reasons.1) It's stretchy so you can pull the straps tighter for a more secure, snug fit.2) The fabric is more breathable which is really good for summer babies since it's not as hot. Also, the fabric has a nicer, softer feel.3) It ties in the front instead of the back so it's comfortable to sit down in.Also, it's less expensive!I wrap it before I leave the house so I can just grab baby out of the carseat and put them in for errands.After you get over the initial confusion of wrapping this it's a breeze to pop baby in, go about your day, and nurse in this.

I was given two Moby wraps as gifts before he was born, and had even given a Moby wrap as a gift to a friend before I had a baby.  A few weeks after he was born I decided to try the Moby, I figured out the wrap part pretty quickly but I couldn't figure out how loose to wrap it to fit my rapidly growing baby.  After a few attempts I finally gave up.  After another few weeks I became really irritated by the fact that I had two perfectly good wraps, but that I didn't want to use them.  I contacted a woman in my town who sells all types of baby carriers (Frogmamma) and went to see her.  She showed me the Boba wrap, I fell in love.  It was the same type of wrap carrier that I wanted, but the material was stretchier (and softer to the touch) compared to the Moby.  You tie it so it is snug against your body and then put baby in, the material stretches to the perfect fit everytime.My son is now 5 months old and 16 pounds.  We still use the Boba wrap (I have two) constantly.  In those first few months it would help to calm him down during his fussy moments, which always happened in the morning.  This wrap allowed me to actually get breakfast while he would sleep.  I bought another Boba wrap and keep it in the center console of my car.

We could use the Boba right away, even though he was still quite small, which was very nice.  It's also well balanced for walking, and I think I'm getting a nice little extra leg workout.

As time went on, it got worse. He started getting hysterical within 5 minutes of me putting him in it and ultimately, I gave up. I'm not entirely sure why he hated it so much, my only guess is that he found it way too hot. Even in just a onesie, he still cried to be taken out after a short time.My other complaint with the wrap is that it is sooo long. It's not a problem if you're putting it on at home but if you're out in public, it's not ideal to have all the fabric dragging on the floor as you set it up.I ended up selling this on Craigslist - if it works for you, I have no doubt that it's amazing but sadly, it wasn't the case for me.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEQA4FMYGEKICNOIRMGPW2QVTA7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEQA4FMYGEKICNOIRMGPW2QVTA7A"

The Boba is made of a stretch fabric so it allows some moving and squirming of my baby as well as shaping to my body.

Don't be intimidated by thinking its complicated to tie-- the picture directions that come with make it very easy. Once our little lady developed reflux & stopped sleeping well day & night, the boba absolutely saved us. She could sleep comfortably upright in it & I could still get things done. Now she sleeps well at night but is still a bad napper. When all else fails, putting her in the boba always always works. A friend at lunch was so amazed when my baby started to get tired & fussy, I popped her in the boba & she just passed out in 2 minutes.  :)My friend is pregnant & went home & added it to her registry! We run all kinds of errands and shop with this too-- so much easier than toting a car seat, my hands are free & baby is more snuggled and happy. Its made of very nice soft fabric & it washes well.

"B005SP2LWW","Great beginner wrap","Breezy Bee","July 29, 2012",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"We have one BOBA and one Ellaroo. The BOBA came first. It is GREAT for learning to wrap your baby. It is also great for when the baby is an infant for front carries. What a lifesaver. Your baby feels safe and you can get something done! We have since moved on to the Ellaroo. While the Ellaroo has a much harder learning curve because it's a stiff wrap, both my husband and I find that it distributes the weight of the baby better (especially as she gets bigger) and you can do back carries with it, which you CAN'T (or definately should not) do with any flexible wrap like the BOBA. Another major reason that we purchased the Ellaroo is that our baby was born in April. The BOBA was going to be way to hot and sweaty to carry our baby in during the summer. The Ellaroo is much more breathable and better for hot weather babies. FYI, YouTube has some GREAT videos for the BOBA (and other wraps) that explain how to get the thing on your body FAR BETTER than the booklet that comes with it. Watch them, you'll save yourself a lot of grief (I got grumpy with the wrap, grumpy with my poor husband... prior to watching the videos). Get a visual, you won't regret it. Even though I like my Ellaroo better, this is still a great wrap and one of the best baby gifts you could get for yourself or anyone you know that has a baby coming.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEX6PCJFXSWYJ2DXQCAFG3QIOZGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEX6PCJFXSWYJ2DXQCAFG3QIOZGQ"

"B005SP2LWW","We couldn't live with out it.","Katy","November 26, 2009",0,"",5,"I got this carrier when I was pregnant with my first baby last spring.  Since the day she was born, this carrier has been awesome.  When she was very little and colicky, this was the only way to sooth her.  I think that was partially because when a small baby rides in this carrier, their knees are tucked into their tummies which helps to get rid of gas pains.I will say there was a month when we couldn't use it.  She was too big to be in the newborn hold and would slide to one side.  At the same time, she was too little to sit with her legs out.  Once she put on a little weight, we went back to using it often.My LO is now 9 months and we still use this carrier on a regular basis.  It's comfortable for both mom and dad.  We even take her hiking in it.  She still loves it, giggling and waving her arms as we walk through the trees.  It also makes for easy public nursing.  The fabric is very wide and can support her head and cover any wobbly bits.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH735F4FPICWHMWFXBYZ3SYXYJIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AH735F4FPICWHMWFXBYZ3SYXYJIQ"
"B005SP2LWW","Very good wrap","Lauren Kawaguchi","November 24, 2009",1,"",4,"I bought this wrap when my baby was about a month old- I was on the fence about babywearing and didn't know where to start. This wrap is an excellent introduction! The fabric is cotton and thick- it feels strong and slightly stretchy. The reason it is 4 stars and not 5 is that now that my baby is older, I have to make the wrap REALLY TIGHT before I put her in or else it starts to sag after about 20 minutes, which doesn't happen with the Moby wrap or probably others that have no stretch to them. I'm pretty petite (5'1"") and making the wrap so tight means I have to wrap this around myself a few times, and that also gets hot. However, on cool days or for general use, it is very secure and my daughter does tend to go to sleep in it, so it does what it says!",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFBPS5AS472DPJQNTCD5KHJZ7CZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFBPS5AS472DPJQNTCD5KHJZ7CZA"

Campbell","November 20, 2009",1,"Format: Baby Product",5,"I had been using a phil&teds pepe carrier for the first 5 months, but once my boy started getting heavy it would dig into my shoulders and he didn't look so comfortable, even though it stated it's designed to accommodate much heaver and older babies.  After much research I decided to order the sleepy wrap in green.  It really is a beautiful shade and gender neutral.  The soft super stretchy fabric is really comfortable for both of us.  I watched several movies on YouTube about tying the wrap, and after the first try myself it was very easy.  I love that I can put it on at home, drive to the mall, then put my son in, without this big bulky mess up front.  Just pull it tight when your putting it on and you'll be fine.  Its easy getting baby into.  Once I have his legs in, I give him a bounce to get him into his final place before adjusting the fabric over my shoulders.I could seriously walk for miles and miles with this carrier.  My 5 month old loves it (I was worried about the transition), people comment all the time, and with living in the middle east any sweaty patches (only once) wash straight out in the washing machine.I am a larger lady and it is generous on fit, I can tie it exactly as per the directions.  If not I could tie it at the front as advised, the back would be equally as secure.The only slight downside, which nothing could be done about, is its length.  If your out and want to put it on find a chair/or your car seat to set the ends on so they don't drag on the ground and get dirty, but then again the don't touch the baby, so you can always pop it in the washing machine once your home.Buy it, you won't regret it.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQCC27ZT4LFI3ANTYOUVGTQHTMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFQCC27ZT4LFI3ANTYOUVGTQHTMA"

The sleepy wrap is better than the Moby.  They are about the same length, but the Sleepy wrap fits both me and the baby better.  I'm plus-sized, and even I could tie the wrap around my waist after crossing in front and going around my waist twice.  I think the tighter tie makes the whole contraption more secure.
