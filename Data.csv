It is just a joy to not have to bend down into the tub, and it is great how it's totally flat when you don't need it.

It fills up with water to keep the baby warm but not submerge them which is important to me in bathing a newborn. The only concern I have about the bath is that where the bath is supposed to fold the magnets don't stay so it tends to unfold in the sink sometimes but this is very rare. I also wish that it would come with the hanging knob for the shower so after I am done using it I can hang it. This part is sold separately.

"B002WWF4IM","and I love it. Since I've had it","M. Wolfe","November 9, 2017",1,"Grey",5,"I've had this tub for almost three years, and I love it. Since I've had it, I buy it as a baby shower gift because it's such a versatile product. I have two children with whom I used this product from infancy to around 7-8 months, or whenever baby started crawling for efficiently.When in use, it's easy to set up, fits into all sinks I've tried (two different kitchen sinks and three different bathroom sinks), and contours well with baby's body. It is made in such a way that if you keep the water running over it, the water drains through the bottom flaps, so you don't have to worry about it overflowing and possibly putting baby in danger. It's soft for baby's comfort but still has grip so baby isn't sliding everywhere. Both of my children that used this never showed any sign of discomfort and actually seemed to enjoy bath time. Because it has no base, you can adjust it at different angles in the sink to elevate the head at your discretion, or lessen the elevation for babies that are not able to sit up on their own yet.My second favorite part about this tub is how easy it is to maintain and store. It unfolds flat for easy washing. Many tubs have little nooks and crannies that require more effort to clean, but the Puj tub is flat so I just wash it down with a handheld shower then hang it on the wall above the tub to dry. When we travel, it folds easily into our large luggage.I have two kids 14 months apart, so I used this tub A LOT until my youngest was old enough to sit up and control his balance in the normal tub. I used this product almost every day for nearly two years and never had a problem with it. I highly recommend it, and will buy it for you if I'm invited to your baby shower.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHEUF43JF5SM3XC3WZMN5SRWVIKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHEUF43JF5SM3XC3WZMN5SRWVIKA"

It fits perfectly in my bathroom sink but not in my kitchen sink, which is a standard sink. I used to wash my baby in thr kitchen sink using the puj when she was small (8lbs) and it worked fine but now when I put her in, the tub opens up because it's not a snug fit on the sink. I would say use it in  kitchen sink only if it fits snuggly because you don't want a naked baby looking at you all confused also the bathtub collapses under them. If it fits in your kitchen sink and you have a detachable kitchen sink head this will forever be your beast friend. Thr faucet will not be so close to your baby thus it is the perfect spot.

"B002WWF4IM","Wanted to love this, but I couldn't","Bookaholic","September 25, 2016",1,"Kiwi",2,"I bought this tub because we live in a small apartment, and the Baby Bargains book recommended it, particularly for small homes/tight on space. I actually feel bad that I bathed my poor child in this for as long as I did. While initially it would seem that the tub would sit in place in the sink and that I could wedge it in the sink, once I placed my baby in the tub, it would move pretty quickly and be unhedged. Imagine sitting in an unsteady piece of styrofoam, floating in water. Yeah, doesn't sound good at all. Also, with the slipperiness and trying to wash the baby, it's easy for the baby to hit his head on the counter or sink. I kept trying to make it work, and, when my husband said that the baby almost hit his head when he used it, that was the last straw. While other bath tubs do take up more space, at least they are safe, easy to use, and, honestly, this tub is so weirdly shaped that it's not easy to store either! You either hang it up flat, and it has a weirdo footprint then, hogging up your wall space and looking weird, or you fold it into the tub shape, and there is no good way to store it. I actually kept it inside my actual adult bath tub just sitting there in the middle of the tub. So, at that point, might as well just get a plastic tub. I think my baby would have been more comfortable bathing in a water cooler. I did love the color though and that it didn't need to be wiped down/just dried fast on its own. I think it's a great idea, and I like supporting women-invented businesses like this one is, but I can't recommend it. I should have bought a little plastic tub (which you can get for even lesser than this -- I mistakenly thought I was saving money). I finally ran out and got the 4moms tub at Target, which is great and fits perfectly in double sinks. The baby really enjoys his baths now, or at least isn't cowering scared. It's possible I wasn't using this tub right, but I am a harried new mom. I don't have time to troubleshoot something that I could find an easy replacement for. Also, I can't see how this would fit in anyone's luggage easily. It's touted as a great travel solution, but, even as a luggage fiend, I don't have any luggage or bags this would easily fit in.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF2RTO3HGRAC7LX4U75XFJ24SG6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF2RTO3HGRAC7LX4U75XFJ24SG6Q"

The foam is soft and creates a nice cushion for baby. Those are the only positives. I ended up hating this tub because it doesn't fit properly in our sink which is a standard oval sink. As soon as you put the baby in it, it comes apart because the magnets are not strong enough to hold the weight. This started happening immediately with our 7.5 lb newborn. You also have to keep the water running because it flows out of the tub too fast and the baby gets cold.

EVERY TIME the tub popped apart, which with a slippery new baby is a really fun and exciting way to give a bath (sarcasm). I will be contacting Puj directly to express my frustration. Our return window closed before our baby was born (that's what we get for planning early *insert eye roll here*). Unless you have the same sink they have in the pictures, I would buy something else... or at least something without those GD magnets.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHJZ5JOOJG3LF7JSICXXEVXGTAUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHJZ5JOOJG3LF7JSICXXEVXGTAUA"

This tub sets up and can be put in a sink, alleviating any back pain from having to bend over.  It also has slots on each side that drain the water, so it never fills up too much for baby.  Once you are done it drains easily through the slots and opens up flat to be stored in small spaces (like between a tub or sink and toilet).  It is a life saver!  I found that we could use it for our son up until he got to 12-15 lbs.

"B002WWF4IM","THE BEST","Bethany O.","December 8, 2014",1,"White",5,"Given to me by a friend at a baby shower, who said as soon as she used one, it became her ""go-to"" shower gift because it was so perfect.  now, along with the baby 411 book, it is my ""go-to"" baby shower gift. This tub is really truly PERFECT for newborn through 6 months baby.  I used this tub from newborn through about age 6 or 7 months, when baby had the muscle control to really sit up in the sink on his own.  I also own an baby/ toddler plastic tub which I switched to shortly after this one.  Although the plastic tub had a newborn ""sling"" it really did not compare in terms of ease of use for several reasons.First, the puj sits at a good angle in your sink allowing baby to recline.  You wash baby as baby is reclining, without having to manipulate baby's position while wet.  So much safer.  With the other tub, I felt that I always had to keep one hand on babys back at all times, whereas with this tub, the baby is safely cradled so that you have both hands to use to wash.  Water pools slightly at the bottom of the puj so baby stays warm, however. drains fairly quickly.  I usually kept the water running through the bath and let the water run on the side of the puj, which kept baby warm and the tub slightly filled with water.  Also, it is SO much easier to give baby (0-6 month) a bath at sink level rather than bending over to use the tub or infant tub on the shower floor.  Especially if you have a c section (I did) and bending over those first few weeks was painful.The foam backing is soft and very flexible, and I took this with me on trips and seemed to fit different sinks with ease.  Also, just fyi, it comes in one large piece that you fold together along lines to create the reclined position.  Very, very easy to clean up:  just flatten, run water over, done.  Also stores easily:  I put mine in the shelf with the cookie sheets in the kitchen.This was one of those miracle items that made the very scary idea of bathing a newborn and small baby very safe and easy.  it also  just gave me a lot of peace of mind about baths.  H-I-G-H-L-Y recommend to new parents.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFGF3CFFMNSXNNQBQ5RVUHENC2QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFGF3CFFMNSXNNQBQ5RVUHENC2QQ"

"B002WWF4IM","Unfortunate purchase","Moxie","December 17, 2013",1,"White",1,"I'm so sad to be writing this poor review. As a new parent, it was my goal to stay budget-friendly and only purchase items that were really going to be useful. After bathing the baby until his cord was healed with just a warm, wet cloth, I decided it was time to bathe him in the sink. It didn't work  at all. I had registered for the Puj Tub, thinking it looked like such a great solution for those of us with limited space, so I didn't hesitate to purchase it. It's now just taking up wall space, an unused disappointment. Here's what I have to say:Pros:* Baby had no complaints.* It warms up quickly and is a soft surface.* Ultimately it takes up less space than the big plastic tubs.Cons:*It definitely does squeak. Loudly. I think it's badly overpriced for what you get.*The magnets don't hold if your sink isn't perfectly shaped. The baby then falls in the ""cracks"" that are created at the bottom where it's coming apart.* The drain holes vented water all over the edge of the sink and on to my legs and floor. I think this was happening because it was coming apart as stated above.* I couldn't easily get to my baby's back. It's hard to roll side-to-side or to get him to sit up due to the recline (and unstable bottom where it comes apart... seeing a trend?) so I resorted to semi-lifting him out to get his back scrubbed.* The water from the spout ran only on his knee and very little is able to pool, so I'd have to use my hand to fan the water out to get him warmed up/rinsed off. This usually caused more overflow to happen out of the vents.* Due to all the inappropriate bending/coming apart, the structure has started to show wrinkles and creases and isn't holding its shape. Bear in mind that I've only used it 3-4 times.I know bathe the baby with me.

Reading the reviews of others, I believe this works only in smaller sinks (such as the bathroom sink). Because I used it in a larger sink, it kept on coming apart and made for a very messy bath. I tried to fill up my sink with water to prevent it from unfolding but what this caused was the tub to move back and forth which risked my baby almost falling sideways into the sink.- Didn't fully cover my newborn because the holes on the side are meant to get the water to flow out.

We keep the tap running to have fresh water cycling, and use a washcloth over his abdomen (see foto).  This, in combination with the curled up position seems to keep him cozy.My only grievances so far:- The hole at the top, which falls just above the baby head when in use (used to hang tub on a hook) sometimes allows for water to leak onto the counter when we're rinsing his hair- It takes a little practice to get him in a position where we can wash his back (I flip him over 1/4 turn onto my forearm, and wash with the other arm)- Sadly, we're expecting him to outgrow this by 3 months !

"B002WWF4IM","First Bath! Success!","Christian","April 30, 2013",0,"White",5,"It's a cool Tub because it can be used in almost any sink. Preferably bathroom sinks (might prove a bit small in larger kitchen sinks). It's made from a warm soft foam that's anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, hypoallergenic and non toxic. Which, of course, is great for LO's sensitive skin. The foam is sturdy enough to hold baby securely, but soft enough to be comfortable and relaxing for baby during bath time. You can fold it up quick, and then the whole thing unfolds again when you're done so it dries easily and can be stored flat. It's a cool option for sink-bathing babies, and it allows you to stand up during bath time instead of breaking your back hunching over a big bath tub. It's also nice to be able to have both hands free while bathing instead of needing to constantly have one hand on the LO to make sure their secure. It's awesome!

Soft!MINUS: at 5 weeks (and being average size baby) the babe was almost too big for it. The picture on the box is deceiving in that is shows sink faucet high above the tub. In reality most standard sink faucets will be within baby's reach/kick (and most faucets in the bathrooms are stationary). So the faucet is too low and creates more crowding and worry that the baby will hurt himself on it. I ended up covering the faucet with a cloth to make the end 'soft'.The water level will not be very high - I suppose it's a safety feature, but I wish the little one was covered in warm water a little more.In the end I feel it's too expensive for such a short time of use.I transitioned to the Fisher Price Whale tub (love it!) and sort of wish I had it from the beginning.

"B002WWF4IM","Your baby will love bath time!","RanchMom","April 17, 2013",0,"White",5,"We've now used this bath through two babies and still love it.  There are so many wonderful features about this tub and very few flaws.PROS1) Does not mold/mildew.  We've had this tub for 2 years and through 2 moves and it still looks almost brand new.  Super easy to clean.2) Easy for storage/travel.  The tub can hang on the back of your bathroom door.  And because it is so lightweight and portable it is easy to take on trips or to Grandma/Grandpa's house.3) Very soft.  Our babies have both been very comfortable in the soft material.  And I don't have to worry about them slipping around and getting into dangerous water.  (Although I would never leave their side during a bath).CONS1) The only con I can think of is that you'll only use this bath for a few months.  Our oldest daughter is a 90th percentile kid and she outgrew the bath within 4 months.  But our 5 month old preemie is still using the tub.2) Price.  Since it only last for a few months some people might not feel it is worth the price when they can find an option that last longer at the same price.  But we didn't feel that way.  It has been a great investment and we'll be able to hand it down to another family when we are done with it since the quality is so good.How to make your baby happy in this tub:Fill the bottom of the tub with warm water that is safe for your baby (use a baby bath temp toy to check).  Also fill a little warm water and baby wash in the pink bath basin you got from the hospital and put 2 washcloths and your hair scrubber (also from the hospital) in the basin.  Place the baby in the puj and place one of the wet, warm washcloths on his/her chest and belly.  Use the soapy water in the bath basin to wash your baby with the other washcloth and hair scrubber.  Enjoy your happy, clean baby.Once our oldest was too big for this tub we moved up to the Dream On Me 2 Position Baby Bather Bath Tub, White which she loves and still uses at 20 months.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEVAPVOTJPV3KJPZQ46KGYNJ6WKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEVAPVOTJPV3KJPZQ46KGYNJ6WKQ"

The cushion material was comfortable and sat my baby at a good angle, which I could control by manual placement of the tub in the sink.  She sat well at a lower incline as a newborn and I could increase the incline when she learned to hold her head upright.What I didn't like about the tub was all the water would drain out of the tub and didn't leave a small amount of water to keep her warm during bath time or allow me to dampen a washcloth to wash or rinse.  I used a small bowl or water to solve this problem, not practical.The other feature I didn't like was how close our faucet was to her.  It was a little challenge to get her out and avoid hitting the faucet.  I had to stop using the tub when she would grab the faucet and pull herself towards it.I tried bathing her in our kitchen sink so I could solve some of these problems. The kitchen sink was large enough for me to plug and access water to wet the washcloth and rinse.  This sink also had a faucet I could move out of the way.

It's too small for my condo's kitchen sink and too large for the bathroom sinks, which all seem to be standard sized. Was hoping for an easy to store tub appropriate for city living, but this does not fit the bill. After just two uses with my one-month old, I went out and bought a real baby tub that she can grow with. Because of the way this is product is designed, the water drains out the bottom while the baby is sitting in it. The magnets are too weak to sufficiently hold the product together, which causes the water to drain out. The Puj basically allows you to give a sponge bath in a sink. The baby isn't sitting in any water after less than a minute. You have to keep refilling the Puj from a basin or sponging off your baby with wash clothes dampened in another sink. That is unless you want to keep the water in the sink you are using running constantly, which isn't the safest in an apartment setting where you can't control the water temperature.

"B002WWF4IM","A ""Must Have for Baby"" in our household!","KMF","September 5, 2012",0,"White",5,"I love this tub. Wish we had this when our little one was 3 weeks old! We bought this tub when our girl was about 2 months old & 10 lbs. We just stopped using it around 7.5 months/8 months 17lbs (primarily as she can sit up great in a regular bathtub)The reason we love this tub:1) It did not require 4 hands! When you first have your little one...they can be a bot squirmy, slippery, and limp in your arms! This tub allowed me to wash our girl with ease & without the aid of the hubby needing to help2) Simple & compact: it is so nice to whip this out & put away with no hassles (big tubs are bulky & need more space. With lots of baby items around the house, like a swing, bouncer, walker etc...it's nice to have something compact & useful)3) Quick rinses: The beach is just a quick walk for us so we are always getting sandy & salty. It is so easy to use this tub for a quick rinse where clean water is replenished easily (when you are rinsing, the water begins to over flow out. This is also great just for regular baths where you want to rinse off the soapy water on your little one. The bigger baby tubs need to be drained & refilled.4) Stable: It was completely stable in our standard double kitchen sink. (We could not use it in our bathroom sinks which I was ok with)Only negative I would note is it won;t fit in all sinks as noted by other reviews & the price is a little high...but still, this was a necessity in our home.We also have the baby ""Whale Tub"" which was challenging her first few months. We did begin to use it off/on as she got older as she really enjoyed the water & kicking her legs. But we still loved the convenience & ease of the Puj if we needed a quick bath (due to time or the little one being grouchy!). I have given away most our little one's items that she has outgrown...but the puj tub I am holding onto just in case we have another!",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF6F7ZVISUUS7VAV7SABMEMHCVDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF6F7ZVISUUS7VAV7SABMEMHCVDA"

He may grown out it in in length within another month or so however.  We've used this tub in our large kitchen sink, and like the way it fits better than in our more shallow bathroom sinks, mostly due to the position of the faucet in proximity to our baby's face/head being closer in the smaller bathroom sink.  This tub drains well, keeping clean water circulating, is comfortable for our baby, as well as comfortable for us to stand and bath him.  We've had need to bath our son in the bathtub with out the puj tub on occasion when we've been away from ours, and it's been much more comfortable for us to stand at the sink and use our Puj than to kneel over the bath tub.  It dries quickly and hangs flat which is perfect for our storage needs.

We registered for the tub because of its slim profile and easy storage.It's wonderfully compact, however there are some concerning problems with it.  First unless you fill the sink all the way up with water underneath the tub, the baby gets cold.  I cover him with a wash cloth on his tummy to keep him warm, but that isn't enough.  Second, when you do eventually fill the sink up with water underneath the tub, the tub starts to float away.  In order to keep the tub and my baby from tipping over and sending him head first into the water I have press down firmly on the tub WHILE washing a squirming baby.  Last, the baby doesn't have much room to stretch his legs, which means that it is almost impossible to clean his little nether regions without a serious struggle.Today, I dragged myself to Babies R Us and bought a huge, ugly plastic tub that has a more baby-ergonomic shape.

It's even better if u have a higher faucet but if u don't, it still serves it's purpose. Soft material does not stain or have mildew build up like some tubs can even if u clean them right. Love the fact that I can run the water low the whole bath time and it drains with such ease. Makes me feel like I can clean more thoroughly because I'm constantly using the fresh water which u can't do with a traditional tub. I hated emptying out the other tubs which takes forever to rinse the baby after the soap. It's not a soaking tub so for those with long babies, might want to place a nice size wash cloth over the belly to keep the little one warm. Love the fact that u can handle with one hand while holding the baby. It's still being used, went from my sister to her friend and now another mom in need.

"B002WWF4IM","Perfect After C-Section! Kinder to Your Knees!","CLaM1225","January 24, 2012",0,"White",4,"SUMMARY: Many baby products out there are gimmicks, but it you have concerns about C-Section pain/scars or have bad knees/hips and/or a higher tub wall to reach over, then the Puj Tub is a GREAT product to get you through the first few months of your child's life. The material was so super-easy to clean and way more durable than I thought it was going to be--and it helped the C-Section healing process so much--that we packed it away just in case we have another child in the future.BACKGROUND: After my first C-Section, I didn't have any steps to worry about and our tub walls were rather low, so getting on my knees to give my son a bath wasn't so bad. (It wasn't so good, either. We had an infant tub, but he would slide all over the place, and we could never get it in the ""right"" spot in the bathtub where it would be comfortable.)When I had to have a C-Section with my second son, I had a ton of stairs to contend with and a tub with very high walls, neither of which made washing the baby very easy or very safe. Just getting him in and out of the bath was a painful experience! Then came the Puj Tub (thanks to seeing it on the Ellen show).REVIEW: What a difference! It was easy and efficient to give my son a bath, he had absolutely no fear of the water (unlike my first son in his baby bathtub), and neither my knees nor my C-Section scar gave me any trouble. I also enjoyed the bath experience more because I was up close to my baby and better able to control where I dumped the cup or how he played and interacted in the bath. When it was time to move to the big tub, I was actually disappointed!USE: For a regular bath, I would test the water and fill up my sink until the water covered the bottom of the Puj, then place my son in it. This worked well, keeping him warm and wet and making it easier to bathe him. For quick rinses, I'd test the water, wet the tub, and then stick him in with the water still running. There was enough room between the tub and the faucet where my sink wouldn't fill up and cause a mess.CONSUMER CONCERNS: There was a learning curve in getting it to sit right in my sink. I'm not very mechanical, and it did take me an extra few seconds to figure out the magnets, but that's probably my own failing. Once I figured it out, I didn't have any trouble setting everything up. My husband never liked it, but he was against the idea of baby baths in sinks, anyway. He thinks/thought a sink bath is/was awkward. (He's also a pretty big guy.)I also wasn't sure the material would hold up (or hold the baby), but I was pleasantly surprised by how durable the foam is. It cleaned up well, dried quickly, didn't grow mold or attract mildew, and bounced back to near-flat for easy storage.The size and/or weight requirements may be a problem for some. If you have a rather large baby (mine was a peanut!) or a rather small sink, then the Puj Tub will have limited use for you. As your child gets bigger, s/he will probably outgrow both the tub and sink more quickly than s/he would an infant tub. I was able to use the Puj Tub until my son was well over six months, keeping him secure while still being able to reach all the important parts, but I don't think that's the case for everyone. Be warned that you may still have to buy an infant/toddler tub in the future.Lastly, I made a mess the first few times I used the tub--mostly because I couldn't find the right balance between standing water and running water. If you have a sink with a large vanity or counter, then that's probably the one you want to use. I did have to bathe him once in my friend's pedestal sink, and it worked rather well, but I was ""good"" at the Puj Tub method by then.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEYIEE7FIZH5TZEHUPBTPUJAVLDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEYIEE7FIZH5TZEHUPBTPUJAVLDQ"

It's soft, it cradles well, and the water is shallow for a newborn.  My baby was so relaxed the first time she got a bath, she pooped in it.  :)- easy to use with one hand, lightweight- cleans easily- MOST IMPORTANTLY, it saves a new mom's back, who is still recovering from a tear or a c-section!! Also, who wants to crouch on the floor hunched over a bathtub at this time?- allows bath-time to be a one-person dealCons:- does not fit all sinks.  I had to use mine in fairly standard sinks, the type you'd get with contractor grade materials.  Nothing fancy.  In another bathroom with a semi-raised sink with an oval opening of about 16x14 in, it couldn't fit well, and the faucet got in the way.  Kitchen sinks don't work, as they are too big to hold the puj tub effectively closed- when baby gets more active,  the feet push and stretch out the foot end of the tub, causing water to run out- also the head part is not that well supported.  When my baby arched, her head almost hits the sink.- water seems really shallow as baby gets bigger.  I worry about baby getting cold.  Again, my use was nowhere near 6 monthsOverall, it's a great tub for a short period of time.  If it cost $10, I'd be giving it 5 stars, but at $40, I would think twice.

"B002WWF4IM","Concept is great, delivery needs work","A Teacher","January 1, 2012",0,"White",1,"I bought this tub for my second son because I used one of those cheap sponge things to bathe my first son in the kitchen sink.  I thought this would be great because I could place the baby in the sink and it would cradle him while I bathed him, and I wouldn't have to hold him up at an awkward angle.  Well, first of all, the first time I put it in the sink I realized it was not large enough to fill the sink, which became a serious problem later on.  When you fill this tub, you have to fill the sink almost to the top, otherwise, the water leaks out the holes into the bottom of the sink, and the baby sits on a tiny puddle of water with no water surrounding him at all - and he FREEZES!  Plus, the tub is in the way, so you can't get your washcloth down into the water to get it wet so you can wash him.  You either need to fill the sink all the way, or leave the water running - which presents the problem of scalding or freezing the baby when the water runs too cold or too hot at first.  I chose to fill the sink all the way - which leads to a whole new SERIOUS issue -- the tub FLOATS!!!!!!!!!!  I placed it in the sink securely, filled the sink, checked the temp, undressed my baby on the kitchen island right next to the sink, and when I turned to put him in -- the tub was floating on top of the water!  I had to fight to get it positioned properly to put my son in the water -- if I set him down wrong and he was too low in the seat, when I lifted him to reposition him, the tub would float and I'd have to fight with it all over again.Now, fortunately, my baby LOVES the water, but he wiggles (like any baby would) - especially when I pour water over his head.  This added to the fact that it is impossible to position a baby properly in this tub because it floats up the second the baby's weight is lifed -- well, when he wiggles, he slides down in the tub - He is in the 90th percentile and so, is larger than most babies, so I can only imagine the sliding down would be even worse with a smaller baby.  My son has slipped down under the water more times that I can count in this thing - actually slipped right down, head under the water!!!  This is a serious safety issue.  Obviously, I was right there and pulled him out immediately, so he was never in any danger - but how can you design a tub that makes it impossible to position a baby without floating up in the water, increasing the baby's risk of falling out of the tub and putting him in danger of drowing?!?!  By the end of the bath, my son usually slides down to the edge of the tub, then wiggles up when I rinse his hair, causing the tub to slip up behind him and literally 'float away' so I am left holding my son up at an awkward angle while I finish his bath and the tub floats behind him and hits him in the back of the head repeatedly.  The only way to place the baby in the tub is to hold him in one hand over the water(he weighs 15 pounds at 4 months - so this is NOT easy to do)  while pushing the tub down to the bottom of the sink with the other hand, and then sort of ""dropping"" him down into the tub so his bottom hits the tub just right, weighting it down so it won't float.  How ridiculous is that?!  And if you don't land the baby in the tub just right, it tilts in the water, throwing him off balance and - eventually, as he wiggles, underwater.....So, you have to pick the baby up to reposition him - but the second you lift him up even a little, the tub floats up again, so you need to do the whole awkward dance of holding it down while you hold the baby up so he doesn't go underwater all over again!Very disappointed.  No, I have not bought a new tub -- this thing was expensive, so I intend to use it until my baby can sit up, but not because I like it.  I just don't want to go out and spend more money on another tub.  I like the idea of the tub, but the implementation of a good concept needs some serious, serious work.  I can't believe how this tub puts babies in such risk of drowning.  I worry about first time parents with this thing.  I was fortunate to have the experience of bathing my firstborn in a sink while holding him up.  I can't imagine what would have happened if this was my first baby and the tub slipped up behind him while I was bathing him and floated away -- the thought of an inexperienced parent trying to fight with this tub and needing to hold a squirming, slippery newborn up in the water with a big white tub floating up behind him without being prepared for that possibility makes me shudder.  I would NEVER give this as a gift to a friend - it's like saying ""I hope your baby drowns.""  I guess the one plus is, my baby will never be afraid to dunk his head underwater....he's been dunked underwater more times than I can count with this thing.  I really wanted something that would make baby's bath time more enjoyable and less frustrating.  I guess it makes for an interesting bath experience...not exactly what I was looking for, but, there's certainly never a dull moment for either of us with the puj tub around.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFKSG6KL6FVRMN4YI2S7VRMKPVCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFKSG6KL6FVRMN4YI2S7VRMKPVCA"

And we've tried LOTS of tubs.  It is both relaxing for the parents and the baby.  (We never found a tub that worked with our first son until he was able to sit up on his own, but I don't think the PUJ existed at the time.)I think he likes it because of the way his bottom is held in place at the base and probably because it keeps enough water around him to keep him warm.  The foam material is not cold to the touch either with water in it.Seriously it is amazing how much more relaxed our son is in this tub vs the other tubs.Note that the first thing you'll think when you open the package is: I REALLY paid this much for a thin piece of folding foam plastic!?!  But once you see how relaxed your kiddo is in it you'll quickly be OK with it.A couple notes on sink dimensions.  I see some people who aren't happy because it doesn't fit in their sink.  It fits perfectly in our double kitchen sink...  Here are the dimensions of the side of the sink we put the tub in:  14"" x 15.5"" width and length at the top and then 7.5"" deep.Really the top dimensions are the most important since the tub mostly rests there.  You could put a folded towel under it if your sink is too deep.  I bet it would work fine +/- an inch or so of these dimensions.

"B002WWF4IM","Awesome Newborn Tub!","Jesikah G.","December 8, 2011",0,"White",5,"As a first time mother, I don't have the luxury of experience to guide me in my baby-related purchases. I added this to my baby registry because a) we needed an infant bathtub and b) because it looked pretty darn cool! I really wasn't expecting to love the Puj Tub as much as I do. I will list all of the features I love about the Puj Tub but don't go looking for the list of ""cons"" as, for me, there are none.EASY TO USE: It wasn't particularly clear to me, based on the photos available when I placed this on my registry, how the Puj Tub folded up from flat piece of foam to 3 dimensional tub but when I pulled it out of the box, it became very clear. There's 4 plastic-covered magnets down at the bottom that hold the folded foam together, creating the tub. Easy-peasy!SPACE SAVING: The fact that this tub flattens out is an awesome feature. The drainage holes offer built-in holes from which the tub can be hung on a hook, if desired. For some time, we used this tub in our pedestal sink in our downstairs half bathroom and chose to tuck it behind the sink. It doesn't completely ""disappear"", but it certainly isn't an eye sore either.COMFORTABLE: The foam that the Puj Tub is made out of is dense enough to provide structure yet soft enough to create a comfortable cradle for baby to enjoy tubby time. I never once felt that my daughter was uncomfortable in the Puj Tub.STYLISH: The white color and curved lines make for a stylish infant tub...much more attractive than the typical molded plastic infant tubs.LONG LASTING: For our daughter, this tub has continued to ""fit"" her well into her fifth month of life. Granted, she was born prematurely at a petite 5lbs and 17"" in length, but she quickly ""caught up"" and is now, at 5 months, 16lbs 10oz and 27"" in length. We alternate using the Puj Tub in the pedestal sink in the half bath and the vanity in the master bath. The variation in the depth and shape of the sinks causes variation in the pitch of the recline of the tub. In the more laid-back position created by the master bath vanity, the back of her head is just now approaching the top of headrest area. Actually, if a headrest extension were available (maybe it is...I dunno), we would be able to continue to use the Puj Tub until she is able to sit self-supported in the sink itself. This is definitely an item that will go into storage for future children.EASY TO CLEAN: We use a castile-based soap that tends to leave a fair amount of soap scum on the foam of the tub. We clean the Puj Tub about once per week with a few squirts of scrubbing bubbles. The scum comes right off and the cleaner rinses away completely, leaving the sparkling white tub we pulled out of the package.I'm sure there are more things I like about the Puj Tub but, at nearly 2am, they are escaping my mind. LOL I would definitely recommend this tub to everyone with an infant that doesn't sit upright on her own yet, not just those living in small spaces.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGEDV4SUSFTYE2FLXSDBY2HVEVJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGEDV4SUSFTYE2FLXSDBY2HVEVJA"

My baby was born at the end of September in Zurich, Switzerland, so it's not a good tub for us.I still use the Puj Tub, though!

I now put the Puj Tub on the counter next to the sink with the hooded towel on top so that my baby goes straight from the water to towel in less than one second. It's working out great!

Unfortunately, I'm now looking to buy one of the bulky infant bathtubs I was hoping to avoid since this tub doesn't work for us anymore, so I wish we'd just saved the money.PROS:-- The seat is soft and cushy and seems comfortable for our daughter.-- It goes flat and is so easy to store.

Before our baby was born I thought it would fit in any of our sinks, but once we put an actual wiggly baby into the tub I found that the magnets didn't hold.  So, I've only been able to make the tub work in one of our three sinks which happens to be about the right size to wedge the edges of the tub into the sink so that it stays at least semi-assembled.-- Because it only fits in our smallest sink, our baby never gets much more than a glorified sponge bath, which is great for water conservation but not nearly as much fun for our baby. (I've given her baths in a big sink with another person to help support her since the Puj tub wouldn't stay assembled, and the baby loved kicking and splashing.)-- Our daughter only really fit in it up until about 12-14 pounds.

We used it on one side of our double kitchen sink and she fit perfectly inside it (6 lbs, 8 oz when she came home, maybe 7.5 lbs at the time of her first bath?). I really like several features of this tub:1. Never had concern for baby's safety -- the soft foam that makes up this tub seems very comfortable for the baby to sit in.2. Genius design -- when I purchased the tub, I couldn't tell how it worked from the photo.  It is a large single piece which folds inward on each side. Once it is folded (it actually snaps into place), it is held in place by magnets (I believe). This creates the contoured bowl-type shape that baby sits in. There is enough ""depth"" to it that baby will actually sit in the water, yet the spaces in the sides of the folded tub don't allow for the water to get too high. Also, the edges are very soft and I noticed that she never had any red marks on her skin when she would move her legs across an edge.3. Dries quickly -- We would hang the tub to dry after her bath. Very thin and easy to hang behind a door -- a space-saving must-have if you are in an apartment or smaller home.All in all, a great purchase, and something I would highly recommend to new parents.

Since the tub was so expensive, I'm determined to use it and have found that if I use the baby washcloths (thank goodness they come many to a pack) to plug up the drain holes, it holds just enough to bathe him.

"B002WWF4IM","The best back saving invention","X. Nguyen","July 15, 2011",1,"White",5,"My son has been using this since he was born.  He is now 18 pounds and still uses it. He lovesssss it and can sit in it all day.  I've used it in a variety of different sized sinks.  It takes a little bit of getting used to, but it's workable, depending on how you fold the tub.  Now that he's bigger and heavier some of the deeper sinks are not compatible with it.  It is pricey for just a piece of Styrofoam though.  We have owned it for 5 months so far and the material has held up fine.  Although I agree if your child is heavier I don't know how much longer this product would be useful, but so far we love it.

"B002WWF4IM","Great when used with the Prince Lionheart FlexiBath!","Rachel Stegman","July 2, 2011",0,"White",4,"The main complaint I have with this tub is that you have to have a sink with a specific dimension/shape.  It didn't work with any of the sinks at both my place and my parents' place.  So it didn't get used for the recommended newborn to 17 pounds timeframe. I used and LOVED the WashPod instead.Now here is the twist in the story!  I used the Prince Lionheart WashPod for my baby's first 6 months (LOVED IT BTW)!  Then I got the Prince Lionheart FlexiBath for my baby for 6 months on.  This company claims that the FlexiBath can be used for newborns. However, it is really difficult to use for babies who are under 1 year old because even if they can sit unassisted outside the tub, they cannot sit at all in the tub when there is water in it. So I would recommend it only for babies closer to a year old UNLESS you use the FlexiBath tub with the Puj Tub!!!  Now the Puj Tub has a new life (after the recommended 6/7 month use period)!  It fits fantastically in the FlexiBath. I called both companies to tell them about my find, and I think they should cross-promote.So, if you are like me and like ""alternative-style"" bathing for your babe--different from the usual ""American laying-back-style"" tubs--then my recommendation is the WashPod and/or the Puj Tub (if you have the right shape/size sink) for baby's first 6 months. Then use the Puj Tub WITH the FlexiBath from 6 months to 1 year. Then the FlexiBath solo from 1+ years.Also, I like to bring the WashPod and the FlexiBath-Puj Tub combo into the shower with me...I find it keeps him warmer and we both get clean together!",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE5T4U6PF7KLMO365GZJAOYRLM3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AE5T4U6PF7KLMO365GZJAOYRLM3Q"

"B002WWF4IM","Great tub; a little pricey.","A. Krause","June 26, 2011",0,"White",4,"I got this tub used on e-bay for about $30. It is very supportive and my daughter seems comfortable in it. It makes bathing her in the sink pretty quick and easy. I do wish it held a little more water. She is now 2 1/2 months old, just under 10 lbs, and the water really only covers her little bottom and part of her back. I do like that it keeps her head comfortably above water. But I would like to immerse her legs and belly a bit more.I have tried 3 different methods of rinsing with this tub:1. I get the water to the right temperature at a low pressure and let it run during her bath, leaving the drain open under the tub. That way I don't have to worry about turning the water on while she's under the faucet and dousing her with too cold or hot water. The downside to this is wasting water.2. I plug the drain once she's in the tub (if she's not in it it floats up) and turn the water off once the sink is full. Then I use a wash cloth to rinse her, bending up the corner of the tub to dip it into the water in the sink.3. I fill a pitcher with water before the bath (like they show in the video).All methods work pretty well, but I prefer the first two.I recommend the tub if you don't mind spending the money for something that is in use for only a few months.

There are magnets that help hold it in shape and we discovered those magnets double as a storage holder - we flatten it and then stick it on the side of our fridge when we're done! There are holes to hang it as well, but I have to say the side of the fridge is pretty handy since its out of sight.

"B002WWF4IM","Fabulously simple and functional","Willis, TX ~ Mom","June 22, 2011",1,"White",5,"First, this was a lifesaver!!  It is simple, easy to use, and very effective.  I found this by accident and purchased it based on the reviews.  I was ELATED to have it after the first use!  No back-breaking, stressing about my baby slipping away from me in the sink, tub, or anywhere else!  All the stuff about folding/flattening for space saving and ease of cleaning is all good and wonderful, but this was just so easy to use to bathe my baby, I can't fully describe how happy I was to know I could safely bathe her!!  She loves baths and I think part of it is because she has always felt so safe, and we have always just been able to focus on bathing, singing, and looking in the mirror at each other while bathing.I have read the other reviews about sinks not fitting, the ""tub"" unfolding, large babies, etc.  Here's what I can share:  I have used this tub in four different sinks, multiple times each.  My baby was 7 lbs 5 ozs 19.5"" at birth, and at four months was 24+ inches and 14 lbs 5 oz ~ so she's avg to above avg height and weight.  I am still bathing her in this tub and she is now to a point where kicking, splashing and waving her arms in the bathtub is requisite and part of the fun ~ she does all of those things at her current size (she is now four months and three weeks).  I will probably have to move to her ""other"" baby bath tub in the next month if she hits a growth spurt, if not, she will make six months in this tub for sure).As for being close to the water and it suddenly changing temperatures.... well, if the baby is in the sink and the water suddenly changes temperatures, I'm pretty sure this is a risk of bathing in a sink..............just sayin'.  All sinks have this risk; it has nothing to do with this thin, bathing tub!As for the baby being close to the faucet, well, yes, again, if you are getting in a sink to bathe, chances are you are going to be close to the faucet.... this is a function of the overall shape of your sink [obviously].  My baby is at a point where she can sit up quite a bit and grab the faucet and pull on it, etc.  She is also interested in chewing on it.  All of those temptations and abilities, she is still bathing in it and she has not yet turned the water to scalding on herself ~ again, a risk of bathing in a sink!  If you have an uber ""modern"" sink that is more like a runoff than a sink, then bathing is going to be a challenge in such a sink.  (duh)As for the tub ""falling apart...""  The tub has two sets of magnets that take it from ""flat"" to ""tub.""  YES, they can and do come apart while bathing (sink dependent).  HOWEVER, not in every sink, and it hasn't posed a problem for me when it did happen.  In my master bath sink, it does it every time, so, I actually don't set up both magnets anymore.  I fold the one side and not the other.  It is great.  My daughter's head is always out of the water and she just loves to wiggle and play while we bathe.I understand there may be some shallow sinks in the world.  However, dinging this product because you have a sink that is going to be difficult at best to bathe a baby in is not fair.  This product is simple in its design and very effective in its use.  This is an A+ product and is one of my personal ""must haves"" for all moms!

"B002WWF4IM","Fits ANY sink & Hangs FLAT to dry!","Shane Hartman","June 6, 2011",0,"White",5,"I had my first child almost 9 months ago. I registered for very few items except for ""necessities"" like a breast pump, monitor, etc. I spent a lot of time researching bathing tubs. I was very nervous about bathing my newborn, since I was about to be a first-time mom. So a tub was important to me. This Puj Tub is AMAZING! It fits in every sink we have. With the way it's made, it's impossible for it not to fit in any sink. I saw a review today about how it doesn't fit in someone's sink and that doesn't make sense to me. That's actually what prompted me to write this review. It's pliable and gives you many different options as to how you can make it work for you. I started by bathing my daughter in our bathroom sink, which I think is unusally small. She's very tall and so a few months ago, we moved her to the kitchen sink, where I can use the tub on either side. I started on the smaller side of the kitchen sink, and as she grew taller, moved her to the other side. She's not quite sitting up on her own yet, so at nearly 9 months old, I'm still using this tub to give her support. I cannot recommend it enough. The second best thing about this tub (and the reason I bought it) is that it hangs flat on the back of my bathroom door. It's extremely light, so I just hang it on a small nail and it dries almost instantly. I'm amazed a tub like this wasn't developed sooner. It's sleek and is perfect for a mom who either doesn't want baby things in every room of the house, or for a mom who is tight on space. One last thing about this tub...my husband had never been around babies before ours and was very, very nervous to bathe her. He couldn't stop talking about how safe he felt bathing her because of this tub. I have never posted a review, but I found other people's reviews of this tub so helpful when I was doing my research, that I wanted to encourage others that you will LOVE this tub!",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AETRXATIYMO6U34EKS7K6CNIEC5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AETRXATIYMO6U34EKS7K6CNIEC5Q"

There is no risk of her drowning because she can't go anywhere ( of course I always watch her closely). It has become her ( and mine too) favorite part of her bedtime routine.

We've been focusing on organics and Eco friendly products but who's kidding who - in the middle of the night when he floods his changing table and is covered in pee you need to react.  Our first bath was sheer panic.  My husband and I were trying to balance him in his Eco tub with one of us holding him and the other washing him.  It was SCARY.  We decided to sponge bath until he grows into it, but after a few days of that decided we needed to something else that would get him cleaner.I then found the Puj online and it just arrived yesterday.  We were going to try it out this weekend, but we had a diaper explosion last night around 3AM - we opened and set up the Puj in record time. It didn't fit in our small bathroom sink, but it did fit in the kitchen sink (side by side).  Once we set him in it a hush fell over the room.

I didn't have the issue with the magnet giving way and unfolding the tub, because i think that could have been due to the size of the sink (maybe too large for the puj?).I tried to see if it would fit my kitchen sink instead, but it wouldn't.I received this as a baby shower gift. I think it's too expensive to purchase and the product leaves a lot to be desired.If the manufacturer could address the sink size issue (flexibility to fit larger kitchen sinks where faucets are not too close), then it probably would solve the other issues with getting the baby in and out, leaning and lifting the baby, or having the puj unfold when the magnets give way). just my two cents...",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFDRKQANADXVKUL5XTD6Q6U5FWHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFDRKQANADXVKUL5XTD6Q6U5FWHQ"

I was excited to try it out because we have a small bathroom and the space-saving idea seemed great. That is about the only thing that is great about this tub. I liked the idea of the comfort it would provide for the baby. That seems to only work if the baby is perfectly still. It takes two of us to bathe her just to make sure the tub or her doesn't move the handles. The first time I tried bathing her on my own, she almost got burned. She wiggles so much that the tub comes completely undone. Not only that it does not fit in the sink at all. It might fit in the kitchen sink except it seems to need an oval or circular sink to work properly. Also, she is already outgrowing the tub. Not by weight, but by height.

This is my second baby and with the first one, we had the typical newborn to toddler tub that could fit in the sink. The thing I didn't like about that tub was that it was bulky, hard to clean, and water was everywhere!With the puj tub, I am able to store it flat against the shower wall.It fits nicely in my sink with perfect sized holes in the sides to let water escape.The perfect fit in the tub saves my back from excess strain.I can set up the tub easily without worrying about the hassle of cleaning it constantly (since it hangs in our shower, the water from our shower cleans the tub whenever I shower. (Not to mention it is white so you can see if there are any poop stains on the tub).Things I do not like:Definitely is only good for probably the first couple months. My little girl was born at 6 lbs and 14 ounces and at 6 weeks old she still has a good amount of room (she is 10 lbs now). I will have to use my old toddler tub probably after the 4th or 5th month.The magnets on one side of the tub came unglued and I had to fix it. It wasn't that big a deal, but you would think that at 40 bucks it wouldn't need fixing.I have a small tupperware of warm water and soap next to me to bath her with since the tub only holds enough to soak just her lower half. She is content with having her lower half on the water and likes the puj tub.If your baby poops in the puj tub, it sucks because you have to lift her out to get the poopy water out and refill it with fresh water...though I guess you would do that with any toddler/newborn tub : ) Though since you can actually do all this with one hand, it is a perk with the puj tub and not a disadvantage.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFCB6PEQR36WANPQXLZXYHHAU5YQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFCB6PEQR36WANPQXLZXYHHAU5YQ"

"B002WWF4IM","Innovative and neat, but expected better quality.","J.Lopez","March 8, 2011",0,"White",3,"I read reviews on this tub and was very excited to try it when my baby was born.  I ended up getting it as a gift and totally loved it at first.  Here's what I loved:* Stores flat* Fits in the bathroom sink* It's made of foam,so it's soft* Looks cooler than those other plastic baby tubs* Keeps baby at an angle* Magnets keep the tub folded together.  It won't accidentally pop open on its own.* Drain hole allows water to release, no need to worry about water level getting too high for baby* Because it's made of foam, you don't have to worry about placing your baby on a cold surface.My baby is 3 months old now and we've hardly used it because we found that it was just easier for us (and warmer for her) to take her into the regular bathtub with us.  That is more of a personal preference thing.  Some parents may not feel comfortable enough to do that.  So now that I've had time to use the puj tub (even if it wasn't that much), here's what I'm not crazy about:* The Price* Quality of the foam: For $40, I would've expected better quality.  We've used the tub only about 5 times and it's scratched up and can easily get indentations in it if you're not careful about what you put on top of it or lean against it.  I guess I was expecting material more like a thick yoga mat or something.  Old Navy Flip Flops have better quality than this.I'm glad that I got it as a gift and didn't pay for it because I'd probably be a little more unhappy about it.  I'm just glad that it stores flat so at least it's not taking up that much space.  I can't say that you could probably use it over and over through the years because I don't think the foam will last that long.  Maybe through a second child.  Maybe.

We bought a bath sling to use in the Flexi-Tub while he still is too young to sit up.  Puj Tub does require a specific style of sink to fit properly and safely.

I got the Puj as a gift when our baby was 4 months old, and I only wish I had gotten it earlier.  It is THE BEST bathtub.  I love everything about it.  It is so soft and supportive for the baby, and I can't figure out how she would be able to intake any water, which is its best feature; it is such a safe tub, and that is the biggest reason I love it.  Her head is completely above any water, and there is no risk of her slipping--it is a surface that really grips her skin, and it holds her in a cozy position.  She is much happier in it (she used to scream at deafening decibels throughout her entire bath...now I put a rubber duckie on her stomach during the bath, and she is happy as a clam). With the other tub, I had several friends whose babies had slipped down into the water, and I was always worried she was going to intake water.  I also had to hold her the whole time, or she would flop to the side and hit her head, and that made it tricky to bathe her at the same time.  None of this is a worry with the Puj tub, because it is soft, supportive, and doesn't hold enough water for me to even have to worry about her taking in any water.  I have both hands free to wash her in, and I can't think of another tub that is safe enough to really give you the liberty to have both hands free throughout the entire bath.  Our sink is really small, so the back water outlet is above the sink.  I put a dirty burp rag to catch water back there, and, voila!...problem solved.  There was some concern about the bath floating by one reviewer, but it is not supposed to be on top of any water--it is only supposed to be filled with about 2 cups of water, so it shouldn't be floating on anything...it should be sitting in the sink with an open drain, so the water is draining out of the Puj.  I hooked it on the wall behind the door...some people had complained that it was too wide to put on the door...I don't really see that being such a big deal (the blue bathtub is huge to store--the is 1/2 inch against the wall...I love that).  And, it is SO easy to clean up from a bath, I am saving water--use about 1/5 the amount I did before.  I can set up the bath in 10 seconds, with one hand.  I could go on and on.

The verdict: Too much stress on my back and chest, and we concluded that it was from the recent stress of leaning over the tub. When I got pregnant with my 2nd child I did tons and TONS of internet research to see what the best baby bath tubs were, and I randomly found this while ""tub surfing"". I read reviews at multiple websites and concluded that this was exactly what I needed.When it finally came I was so excited, but it wouldn't go in my sink, because I had a low faucet (similar to this one: Moen 4938STST Castleby Satine 2 Handle Bathroom Sink Faucet). I had to have the low faucet replaced with a higher one (like this one: Delta Faucet 2538 Lahara Double-Handle Lavatory Faucet, Chrome (Not CA / VT Complaint)) so the tub would fit. (I purchased this same tub for my sister-in-law, and the bowl in her bathroom sink was larger than mine, so she didn't have to replace her low-medium faucet.)After that it was smooth sailing.

It's so easy to use and clean, and we were able to get a good 6 months use out of it.

I don't know what kind of sinks the negative reviewers had but it fits my sink (molded shell sink) and a hotel sink (undermount sink) fine. It does collapse in my kitchen sink but it's not really meant for square sinks. Here's my pro's and con's:Pros:- very comfortable for baby- constantly drains so water stays fresh and baby gets rinsed easily- takes up no space (I hung it on the back of the bathroom door)- cradles baby securely so parent's hands are free- no bending!! baby is right there with you- baby can look in mirror while being bathed my daughter loved this- baby has a blast playing with the water coming out of the faucetCons:- You'll be lucky if you can push using this to 5 months. Most babies will probably outgrow it by 3 - 4 months- expensive, it's a great idea but that's what you're paying for, it probably cost them about $0.20 to make- It does mark up easy and after 5 months of use it definitely looks used, no passing this on to someone else.To me it was worth the money because it made bathing my newborn so easy I couldn't imagine anything else. I tried those plastic tubs with the mesh and my daughter just wasn't comfortable in them and they are so huge to store.

He fits perfectly in the kitchen sink =) He's happy and so are we.Our baby is now 5 months old (26 inches & 16 pounds) and we are still using the PUJ. My husband and I love this baby bath tub and so does our baby. A lot of the reviews don't do this product any justice.1. The tub is still in great condition as we bathe baby every other day. Other types of tubs would have had soap scum or other build up by now. I am very happy that I haven't had to clean and scrub this tub.2. We bathe baby in the kitchen sink and leave the water running so that the water supply is constant and fresh. Yes the water runs out of the holes, but that is good because he's not sitting in old dirty water (potty accidents). He doesn't get cold because we are constantly rubbing soap on him and rinsing him with the fresh, warm water. When it's time to drain the tub, we simply flip it over so that it is inverted in the sink while we dry and dress baby. It is so easy.3. Yes, the tub floats-it's made of a soft, foam-like material. You're not supposed to fill or plug the sink and place the tub in it. Watch the video and you'll see how the tub is supposed to be used. If you'd rather not bathe baby that way, maybe the PUJ isn't the tub for you.4. We position the PUJ diagonally in our square kitchen sink and it has never lost it's shape or had the magnets disengage when we used it correctly. The only time that happened was when I tried to fill the sink before bathtime, which is the wrong way to use the PUJ.The PUJ is a lifesaver! I am a new mom and was very anxious about bathtime. It can be very dangerous bathing a newborn/infant and I feel that the PUJ has prevented bathtime accidents that might have occurred if we used another type of tub.

Talk about scaring new parents!Also, they forget to mention that you can't use it immediately as you need to wait until the baby's umbilical cord falls off.  Then they outgrow it when they hit about 2-3 months.  So for $40 you get 1.5 month's worth of use.  Bad economics, really.It wouldn't fit any of our sinks so we shoved it into our kitchen sink so at least he couldn't hit the faucet of our bathroom sinks.  I refused to let $40 go to waste, but I'm ashamed to say we weren't able to bathe the baby as often as I wanted because the tub was a total safety hazard if there weren't two of us there to bathe him.Pro:  Soft on baby's skin, folds up flat to hang on wall and takes up no space whatsoever.Cons:  Magnets don't hold, can't use until umbilical cord falls off at about 3 weeks then baby outgrows it at about 12 pounds or so at 2 or 3 months (basically 1.5 months worth of use), was impossible for me to use by myself because it would either deform in the sink (deeper sink) or he would fling his head or arms into the faucet (normal bathroom sink).",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFM63NR2VTKZS5QUESJS6FYWMBEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFM63NR2VTKZS5QUESJS6FYWMBEA"

So it makes it look terrible and I won't even give it away looking like it does.Because of these problems, it is most certainly not worth $40. They need to make revisions to this-SUCH a great idea though.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFNCA4KQ375TMGFA5VUV2DFXR55Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFNCA4KQ375TMGFA5VUV2DFXR55Q"

I contacted customer service about it - and was basically given a ""tough luck"" from them.  Waste of money if you are looking to use the kitchen sink - better off just lining it with a towel and saving your cash.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGNE3RVDRHLXWTJ4GTDPIBWF5O3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGNE3RVDRHLXWTJ4GTDPIBWF5O3A"
"B002WWF4IM","It's too small for my baby and did not fit in most sinks as it claims to.","Amelia's mom","June 21, 2010",0,"White",2,"I was sold on this tub due to the fold flat for easy dry, fits in sink and it being non-toxic, BPA free and made in the US.  The problem is that it did not fit in any of my bathroom sinks - the faucet is dangerously close to baby and too awkward to get her in and out.  I was able to use it in my kitchen sink.  My 3 month old baby is in the top 95th percentile for her height and weight - has been since two months old - was 24 inches long when I started using this product and she was very scrunched up but didn't seem to mind.  I finally purchased the First Years Sure Comfort Infant-Toddler Tub last weekend and started using it today and I have to say that It is so much better - more room and fits securely on top of the double sink in my kitchen...and it was only $18.  I wish I got that in the first place and didn't waste the $40 on this one.  If you have a tiny baby, this might work but if you have a long baby do not waste your money on this.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHL5LEQ72W7OQPXONX5UUC3JQSCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHL5LEQ72W7OQPXONX5UUC3JQSCQ"
"B002WWF4IM","Successful at what it is","Jinky","June 18, 2010",1,"White",4,"I bought this because we don't own a bathtub and don't have room to store those large baby tubs.  It has worked very well for its purpose (stores flat, fits in our small, odd-shaped sink).  I would, however, like to mention some minor frustrations.First, rubbing the material makes a horrid squeak, like when Styrofoam is rubbed.  I know, it's a minor thing, but I really just hate that sound, and it happens whenever I shift my baby in the tub.Second, I have learned to bolster the back of the tub (where her head is) with a rolled-up towel, or else the tub will cave backwards.  The material just isn't rigid enough to support the weight of her head/upper body without the added support. This may not happen with everyone, but it does with my shallow sink.Third, my daughter is now just under four months old and she's almost grown out of using the tub.  Granted, I never expected to be able to wash her in the sink forever :)  But I though it would give us more time than it has.Such small matters aside, it has proven to be an inexpensive and practical way to bathe my little girl for the last four months, and so I consider the purchase a success.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQBKQLVADQF2BPC526FPD3VGMLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFQBKQLVADQF2BPC526FPD3VGMLQ"

Because I didn't think it would be big enough for a 6 month old baby like it says, I also had concerns about whether it would fit in my sink. I am so glad I ordered it! It fits great in both my bathroom and kitchen sinks. It will definately hold a bigger baby. The tub is made up out foamie stuff that is sturdy yet moldable. The foam keeps the baby from sliding all over the place. The angle at which the baby sits is perfect. They are snug and secure. Folds up so easy my 4 year old can do it. When you are done with it unfold it and hang it up. It saves a ton of space from the tradition hard plastic bathtubs. Love it! I don't know how I lived without it with my first child.

Unfortunately, the Puj Tub did not sit deep enough in the sink to work properly.

"B002WWF4IM","Good idea but only for tiny infants","lalalulu","March 28, 2010",0,"White",3,"We are currently using the Primo Eurobath for our not-quite-2-month-old son. Being a rather large tub, it is difficult to lift to empty the water after the baths, not to mention the pain of having to squat on the floor holding the baby. This is why I was excited to try out the Puj tub in our bathroom sink, standing.Although I was a bit wary that the magnets that create the curve would be too flimsy, it seemed to work. Placing the tub in the sink, it seemed to be a rather tight fit, but when I tried to place my son in it was when the real problem started. I had to practically squeeze his leg under the faucet and when in place, he did not look nearly as comfortable as the baby in the picture. In fact, that picture looks a lot roomier than what I saw, and my baby is a 75 percentile baby at 2 months while the Puj claims to be for 0-6 month babies. Meanwhile, he was also screaming his lungs off.The material is soft, it fits in the tub, and the design seems to have been well thought out (the holes did ensure that the water did not run over, etc etc) but I'm guessing my son might have looked like the baby in the picture for the first couple of weeks and that's it.The Eurobath has its faults, but nevertheless, it's always done the job and I've never had a problem with it. I was hoping for a miracle, but alas... maybe it was all wishful thinking.",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFDKDPNITAH656I6TAVOSUBKB7BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFDKDPNITAH656I6TAVOSUBKB7BA"

"B002WWF4IM","This tub saved my back!","J. F.","February 13, 2010",1,"White",5,"First of all, I've never cared enough about a product to take time out of my busy schedule in order to write a review, so this should tell you how much I truly love this product.  I absolutely love this tub! I went through three infant tubs - a whale and two meshy type things that went in the sink, and none of those worked for me.  It hurt so bad to lean over the tub or in the floor to try to bathe my baby in the whale. In the meantime, it was hard to move him around, get him clean, and rinse him as well because I was having to strain.  The whale tub was too tall to put on a counter or an island.  When I tried the meshy type things in the sink, these didn't keep him warm at all and he hated them!  You couldn't get him clean on those at all. Bath time wasn't fun because I was uncomfortable, he was chilly, and he couldn't play in the water.I saw an ad on facebook for this tub and I was extremely skeptical because my sink wasn't truly round.  It's sort of square at the top and rounded on the bottom.  But man, was I pleasantly surprised.  I just fold up one of the sides and it conforms well to the sink.  My baby absolutely LOVES it!  He laughs and plays now in the water. It's really so easy, you just literally throw it in the sink and you can stand up, without hurting your back, and bathe baby.  Then, when bathtime is over, you just toss the water out of it, unfold it and hang it up to dry on a hook or lay it flat and wipe it once with a towel.  It's seriously the best baby product I have and my husband and I enjoy giving our baby a bath every day!  You must purchase this tub - you won't regret it! Especially if your back hurts like mine. This makes bath time so much fun for baby!  It's soft, cradles his little body so well, and is so flexible!  His first laugh was in the bath. :)",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHA7XJWND6LTW53GAFWH3ECPQKXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHA7XJWND6LTW53GAFWH3ECPQKXA"
"B002WWF4IM","perfect solution to bathing baby with older child in bathtub","MelissaGM","February 13, 2010",1,"White",5,"I was a little skeptical at first that this would actually work in my sink, which is small, but this fits with no problem!! it is light weight, flexible and soft, which molds easily into your sink. You can also adjust it so that baby is more upright or lays back.  It IS easy to use with just one hand which is essential.  I love that I can bathe my baby while my toddler is in the bath tub. The Puj also allows me to bathe baby with two hands.  He is safe and comfortable in the Puj and the only time I feel I have to hold on to him is when I rinse the shampoo out of his head.  With the two other tubs I have used, I never felt  comfortable letting go of him completely. The best thing of all is that my baby loves this tub and actually smiles!! I think because he knows I feel more comfortable which relaxes him. Previously, he cried in whatever I tried to bathe him in! It's also nice because he is closer to me & higher up so that probably makes him more relaxed as well. The only problem is that I doubt we can use this as my baby gets much bigger. He is 8 weeks old and a long baby, so I doubt we can use it through 6 months...otherwise, it's a bit pricey but to me, well worth it!  Before the Puj I rarely bathed him, but now I do it every night and I find he sleeps much better!",,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEF4G7TSYXQ3TNXXO4E7YWJG4S2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEF4G7TSYXQ3TNXXO4E7YWJG4S2Q"
